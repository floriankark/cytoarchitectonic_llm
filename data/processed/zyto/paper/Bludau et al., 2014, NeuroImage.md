Introduction


The frontal pole has more expanded than any other part in the human brain as compared to our ancestors. It
plays an important role for specifically human behavior and cognitive abilities, e.g. action selection (Kovach et
al., 2012). Evidence about divergent functions of its medial and lateral part has been provided, both in the healthy
brain and in psychiatric disorders. The anatomical correlates of such functional segregation, however, are still unknown due to a lack of stereotaxic, microstructural maps obtained in a representative sample of brains. Here we
show that the human frontopolar cortex consists of two cytoarchitectonically and functionally distinct areas: lateral frontopolar area 1 (Fp1) and medial frontopolar area 2 (Fp2). Based on observer-independent mapping in
serial, cell-body stained sections of 10 brains, three-dimensional, probabilistic maps of areas Fp1 and Fp2 were
created. They show, for each position of the reference space, the probability with which each area was found
in a particular voxel. Applying these maps as seed regions for a meta-analysis revealed that Fp1 and Fp2 differentially contribute to functional networks: Fp1 was involved in cognition, working memory and perception,
whereas Fp2 was part of brain networks underlying affective processing and social cognition. The present
study thus disclosed cortical correlates of a functional segregation of the human frontopolar cortex. The probabilistic maps provide a sound anatomical basis for interpreting neuroimaging data in the living human brain,
and open new perspectives for analyzing structure–function relationships in the prefrontal cortex. The new
data will also serve as a starting point for further comparative studies between human and non-human primate
brains. This allows finding similarities and differences in the organizational principles of the frontal lobe during
evolution as neurobiological basis for our behavior and cognitive abilities.

Brodmann area (BA) 10 is located at the frontal pole of the human
brain and represents the most rostral part of the brain. It is part of the
prefrontal cortex (PFC). Its large extent in the human brain as compared
to other species (Semendeferi et al., 2001) makes it a candidate for processing “human-specific” functions. BA10 is involved in many higher
cognitive functions such as planning of future actions and the ability
to draw analogies (Fuster, 2008). There are several theories (reviewed
by e.g. Ramnani and Owen (2004) or Tsujimoto et al. (2011)), like the
gateway hypotheses (Burgess et al., 2005, 2007) or the hypotheses of

cognitive branching (Koechlin et al., 1999) which try to combine the variety of neuroimaging findings.
The precise localization of the borders of BA10 using structural or
functional MRI is not possible. In contrast to the primary sensory
areas with their distinct cyto- and myeloarchitecture (Zilles and
Amunts, 2010, 2012), the relatively similar architecture of the various six-layered isocortical areas of the prefrontal cortex does not
provide sufficient tissue contrast for in vivo mapping of such subtle
differences. In vivo mapping approaches, which predict the localization
of areal borders by cortical folding patterns work well in primary cortical
areas, but are less successful in higher associative areas (Fischl et al.,
2008, 2009; Hinds et al., 2008, 2009). Using high-field MRI and the
myelin-based contrast allowed delineating the primary visual cortex
(Geyer et al., 2011), but a definition of borders of higher associative cortical areas and higher sensory areas like that on the human frontal pole

could not be demonstrated until now. Such MR-derived myelin maps are
impaired in regions close to air/tissue interfaces, like the orbitofrontal
cortex and the frontal pole adjacent to the frontal sinus (Glasser and
Van Essen, 2011) because of susceptibility artifacts. Delineating cortical
regions based on connectivity patterns taken from diffusion weighted
MRI in living subjects is another in vivo option which might lead to localization of higher order cortical areas, but this approach requires reliably
and precisely defined regions of interest for fiber tracking (Behrens and
Johansen-Berg, 2005; Johansen-Berg et al., 2004). In the vast majority
of areas, the delineation of cytoarchitectonic areas of the isocortex provides presently the only precise, reliable and reproducible basis for anatomical localization of functional studies and independent evaluation of
structural in vivo mapping approaches.
The cytoarchitectonic map of Korbinian Brodmann (Brodmann, 1909)
(Fig. 1A) shows an area BA10, occupying the frontal pole including the
frontomarginal sulcus, the rostral part of the superior frontal gyrus and
small parts of the middle frontal gyrus. Caudally, BA10 is bordered by
middle frontal area BA46. The mesial border to BA32 is located rostral
to the cingulate gyrus. The rostral end of the olfactory sulcus could be
taken as a gross macroscopic landmark for the borderline to orbitofrontal
area BA11 according to Brodmann's map. A comparable cytoarchitectonic
map (Fig. 1B) was proposed by (von Economo and Koskinas (1925) and
Sarkisov and the Russian school (Fig. 1C) (Sarkisov et al., 1949).
In a more recently published map (Öngür et al., 2003), area 10 is
subdivided into three parts, 10 m, 10r, and 10p (Fig. 1D). Area 10p occupies the frontal pole, while 10 m and 10r are found on the lower
part of the mesial surface of the frontal lobe. The map of Öngür and
colleagues differs from the older maps by the larger extent of area
10 on the mesial surface of the brain. It shows 10 m and 10r as a broad
“tongue” extending on the most ventral part of the cingulate gyrus.
Thus, the parcellations of area 10 provided by these maps differ regarding the number of subdivisions as well as the extent of the areas.
This might reflect interindividual anatomical variability of the extent,
and different parcellations methods and concepts in case of the number
of subdivisions. The interindividual variability is an important aspect of
cytoarchitectonic parcellations as shown by the probability maps of different cortical regions, e.g. various visual areas (Amunts et al., 2000;
Malikovic et al., 2007), primary motor cortex (Geyer et al., 1996), primary and secondary somatosensory cortices (Eickhoff et al., 2006a,
2006b; Geyer et al., 1999, 2000; Grefkes et al., 2001), Broca's region
(Amunts et al., 1999), primary auditory cortex (Morosan et al., 2001),
and parietal cortex (Caspers et al., 2006; Eickhoff et al., 2006a). These
factors influencing cortical parcellation schemes have been discussed
elsewhere (Zilles and Amunts, 2010).
Furthermore, existing maps of the frontal pole have not been published in a format, which enables comparisons with functional imaging
data in a common spatial reference system. This is important, because
recent functional studies showed different activations for the lateral
and medial part of the frontal pole (Burgess et al., 2003; Gilbert et al.,
2007, 2010; Schilbach et al., 2010).
The aim of the present study was to investigate if the functional
differentiation into a medial and lateral region within area 10 is reflected
by cytoarchitecture, and to generate three-dimensional, probabilistic maps. The borders of cytoarchitectonic areas were delineated in
serial histological sections of 10 postmortem brains using an observerindependent approach (Schleicher et al., 1999, 2000, 2005, 2009). Two
new areas, Fp1 and Fp2, were found by quantitative cytoarchitectonic
criteria, and probability maps were generated in a standard reference

space, which capture the intersubject variability in localization and extent, and provide a common reference system for comparison with functional imaging data. In order to better understand the functional role of
the two identified areas, these new cytoarchitectonic maps served as regions of interest for a consecutive coordinate-based meta-analysis.

Material and methods

Histological processing of postmortem brains

Ten brains, 5 females and 5 males, were obtained via the body
donor program of the Department of Anatomy at the University of
Düsseldorf, Germany (Table 1). Postmortem delay of brain extraction
ranged between 8 and 13 h. Clinical records did not show neurological
or psychiatric diseases. Written informed consent was obtained according
to the body donor program by the University of Düsseldorf governed by
the local ethics committee. Histological processing has been performed
as previously described (Amunts et al., 1999). In short, each brain was
fixed in formalin or in Bodian's fixative for at least 6 months. The complete brains were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned on a
microtome (Polycut E, Reichert-Jung, Germany; thickness = 20 μm).
Approximately 5500 to 8000 sections, depending on the individual
brain size, were obtained. The sample used in the present study
included three brains cut in the coronal plane and seven brains cut
horizontally. Every 15th section was mounted onto a gelatine-covered
glass slide, corresponding to 300 μm distance between mounted sections,
and stained for cell bodies using a modified silver method (Merker, 1983).

Observer-independent detection of cytoarchitectonic borders based on
the analysis of the grey level index (GLI)

The delineation of areas was based on an observer-independent
mapping approach (Amunts and Zilles, 2001; Schleicher et al., 1999,
2005, 2009; Zilles et al., 2002). To this end, rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in the histological sections and digitized with
a CCD-Camera (Axiocam MRm, ZEISS, Germany), which was connected
to an optical light microscope (Axioplan 2 imaging, ZEISS, Germany).
The camera and the motor-operated stage of the microscope were controlled by the Zeiss image analysis software KS400 (version 3.0) and
Axiovision (version 4.6).
ROIs were digitized with an in-plane resolution of 1.02 μm per pixel
(Fig. 2A). Gray-level index (GLI) (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990) images
were calculated with KS400 and in-house software written in MatLab
(The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA). Each pixel in a GLI image represents
a measure of the volume fraction of cell bodies (Wree et al., 1982) in a
measuring field of 16 × 16 pixel in the original digitized ROI (Figs. 2E,F),
and therefore reflect aspects of cytoarchitectonic organization of the
ROI. In the next step, an outer (between layers I and II) and inner contour
line (between layer VI and the white matter) (Fig. 3A) were defined. Between both contour lines, curvilinear traverses were calculated using a
physical model based on electric field lines (Jones et al., 2000) (Fig. 3A).
Extracting the GLI values along those traverses leaded to profiles
which could be operationalized with ten features (Dixon et al., 1988;
Schleicher et al., 2009; Zilles et al., 2002): mean GLI value, centre of
gravity in x-direction, standard deviation, skewness, kurtosis, and analogous parameters of the profiles' first derivatives. Each profile was
re-sampled with linear interpolation to a standard length corresponding to a cortical thickness of 100% (0% = border between layers I and
II; 100% = border with white matter), so that profiles of different
lengths could be compared. The extracted features were combined in a
ten-element feature vector, which was used to calculate the Mahalanobis
distance (MD; Mahalanobis et al., 1949) between two adjacent regions of
profiles as a measure for dissimilarity between profiles (Mahalanobis et
al., 1949; Schleicher et al., 2000) (Fig. 3E).
For observer-independent border detection, a specified number of
profiles (block size from 10 to 24 profiles) were combined into a block


of profiles. The calculation of the Mahalanobis distance was performed
using a sliding window procedure for each profile position and all block
sizes surrounding this position (range: 10–24 profiles) across the whole
cortical ribbon as enclosed by the contour lines (Schleicher et al., 1999,
2000, 2005; Schleicher and Zilles, 1990). So the MD between two adjacent regions could be used as an observer independent measurement
for cytoarchitectonic differences.
Significant maxima of the distance function for different block sizes
were found at those positions of profiles where the mid-point of the sliding window was located over a cytoarchitectonic border between two
adjacent cortical areas using a Hotelling's T2 statistic with Bonferroni
correction (Schleicher et al., 1999).

3D reconstruction and probabilistic maps

The extent of the delineated areas Fp1 and Fp2 was interactively
transferred to high-resolution scans (1200 dpi; ~20 μm/pixel; 8 bit
grey value resolution) of the respective histological sections. All histological data sets and the mapped area 10 were 3D-reconstructed.
The 3D-reconstruction was based on (i) the structural magnetic resonance image (MRI) 3D data set of the fixed brain obtained before sectioning and (ii) high-resolution flatbed scans of the stained histological
sections (Amunts et al., 1999). The comparison of these datasets allowed
correcting for deformations and shrinkage inevitably caused by histological techniques, (Amunts et al., 2004; Henn et al., 1997; Mohlberg et al.,
2003). To generate a stereotaxic map and to account for inter-individual
anatomical variability, the extent of the delineated areas of all examined
brains was spatially normalized and transferred to the T1-weighted
single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
brain (Evans et al., 1992). Linear and nonlinear elastic registration
tools were applied (Henn et al., 1997; Hömke, 2006). The delineated
cytoarchitectonic areas were superimposed in this reference brain template, and probabilistic maps were calculated. The probability that a cortical area was found at a certain position, in each voxel in the reference
brain, was characterized by values from 0% to 100%, and color-coded.
Subsequently, a maximum probability map (MPM) was calculated
(Eickhoff et al., 2005, 2006b). Hereby, each voxel was assigned to the
cytoarchitectonic area with the highest probability in this voxel
(Eickhoff et al., 2005). To correctly allocate those voxels which showed
equal probabilities, the neighboring voxels were used to aid in classification. A threshold of 40% was applied at those border regions of Fp1
and Fp2, where the two delineated areas bordered regions which
have not been mapped with the observer independent algorithm used
for the present analysis (e.g., BA46 at the dorsolateral border, and BA9
at the dorsal border of area Fp1 (Eickhoff et al., 2005; Scheperjans et
al., 2008). Finally, we calculated the surface of the maximum probability
map by computing the area associated with each vertex of the midplane
surface and subsequently summed up all area values which were labeled with Fp1 resp. Fp2. The associated area of a vertex is given by
one third of the sum of the areas of the adjacent triangles. Due to the
fact that the surface was calculated based on the maximum probability
map in the reference space of the T1-weighted single-subject template

we had to correct these values by a factor of 1.439. This factor was calculated by comparing the volumes of the (smaller) individual postmortem brains against the volume of the reference brain.

Volumetric analysis of areas Fp1 and Fp2

Fresh total volumes of each analyzed brain were estimated from
its fresh weight and a mean density of 1.033 g/mm[3] (Kretschmann
and Wingert, 1971). To compensate for shrinkage due to histological
processing, an individual correction factor was defined for each postmortem brain as the ratio between its fresh volume and its histological volume (Amunts et al., 2007). The fresh volumes of the delineated


areas were stereologically estimated in each hemisphere using the
high-resolution flatbed scan delineations and Cavalieri's principle
(Gundersen et al., 1988).
The volume of areas Fp1 and Fp2 in each brain was also expressed
as a fraction of total brain volume (area volume proportion: volume
area/brain volume, [%]) in order to make the results comparable for
brains differing in their absolute weight. Differences of the volume
proportion of areas Fp1 and Fp2 were tested for significant effects of
hemisphere and gender differences with pair-wise permutation tests
using in-house software written in MatLab (Eickhoff et al., 2007). For
each of these tests, the corresponding values (male/female; left/right
hemisphere) were grouped and a contrast estimate was calculated
between the means of these groups. The null distribution was

with a repetition of 1,000,000 iterations. The difference between
the two areas was considered significant if the contrast estimate of


the true comparison was larger than 95% of the values under random
(i.e., null) distribution (P b 0.05; Eickhoff et al., 2007) (Table 3). Correlations between volume and age were analyzed by building the
Spearman correlation coefficient.

Meta-analytic connectivity modelling

A coordinate based meta-analysis was performed using a revised activation likelihood estimation (ALE) technique (Eickhoff et al., 2009, 2012;
Laird et al., 2005; Turkeltaub et al., 2002) based on the BrainMap database. This approach determines the convergence of (co-activation) foci
reported from different experiments that activate the delineated regions.
The foci were modeled as probability distributions based on the spatial
uncertainty due to the between-subject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data. Therefore, a location query was performed
[within the BrainMap database (www.brainmap.org, (Fox and Lancaster,](http://www.brainmap.org)
2002)) for studies activating Fp1 and Fp2. The MPM including the
cytoarchitectonically defined areas from this study was used to define
regions of interest. From that database, only those experiments were
considered, that reported stereotaxic coordinates from normal mapping
studies (no interventions and no group comparison) in healthy subjects
using either fMRI or PET. These inclusion criteria yielded (at the time of
analysis) approximately 5000 functional neuroimaging experiments.
Note that we considered all eligible BrainMap experiments because any
preselection of taxonomic categories would constitute a fairly strong a
priori hypothesis about how brain networks are organized. The main
idea of the ALE algorithm is to treat the reported foci as centres for 3D
Gaussian probability distributions to capture the spatial uncertainty associated with each focus. The algorithm shows statistical convergence of
reported activations across different experiments found via the BrainMap
search query. The results are interpreted under the assumption that the
observed clusters have a higher probability than given only random convergence. To identify random and non-random foci clusters the obtained
ALE values were compared with a null-distribution reflecting a random
spatial association between the considered experiments (Eickhoff et al.,
2012). The analysis was thresholded at a cluster-level FWE corrected
p b 0.05 (cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level p b 0.001).

Results

Cytoarchitecture of the human frontal pole

General characteristics
Areas Fp1 and Fp2 represent typical isocortical areas with six layers.
The border between layers II and III was clear cut (Fig. 4). Layer II
consisted of a high amount of granular cells, which were intermingled
by pyramidal cells of very small size from layer III. Consequently, the
impression of a well demarcated border to layer III was mainly caused
by the much lower cell density in upper layer III as compared to layer
II. Layer III showed a gradient in pyramidal cell size from superficial


(larger cells) to deep parts (smaller cells), reaching a medium size of
the pyramids in lower layer III. One of the most characteristic criteria
for the identification of the frontopolar areas was the structure of
layer IV: it was broad and showed a high cell density (Fig. 4). The borders to layers III and V were well defined. The upper part of layer V
showed high cell density and small- to medium-sized pyramidal cells.
In contrast to that, lower parts of V showed lower cell density and
medium-sized pyramidal cells. Layer VI was thick, and showed high cell
density in its upper part. The transition with the white matter was
blurred, mainly because of the low cell density in its lower portion (Fig. 4).
Two cytoarchitectonically distinct areas, Fp1 (lateral) and Fp2
(medial) were identified based on quantitative criteria and a multivariate distance measure according to an observer independent border detection approach (Schleicher et al., 1999, 2000, 2005 Schleicher and
Zilles, 1990). The border between them was approximately located at
the margin of the interhemispheric fissure. Area Fp1 occupied rostral
parts of the superior and middle frontal gyri, whereas area Fp2 was located at the rostral mesial superior frontal gyrus. Area Fp1 showed
higher cell density in layer II and in lower parts of layer III, and a broader
layer IV than area Fp2 (Figs. 4A,B). Upper Layer V in area Fp2 mainly
consisted of medium sized pyramid cells which caused the impression
of a small belt next to layer IV (Fig. 4C). Relatively sharp borders between layers I, II and III, and a well-developed layer IV were characteristic for both areas and distinguished them from neighboring areas.

Cytoarchitectonic borders of areas Fp1 and Fp2 with neighboring cortical
areas and corresponding gross macroscopic landmarks

Areas Fp1 and Fp2 are surrounded by areas 9, 11, 32 and 46
according to Brodmann's map (1909; Fig. 1A). The identification of
cytoarchitectonic areas 9 and 46 was based on studies of Rajkowska
and Goldman-Rakic (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995a, b). Criteria
for the medially located neighbor BA32 were taken from publications by
Palomero-Gallager and Vogt (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008; Vogt et
al., 1995). A summary of the cytoarchitectonic features could be found
in Table 2.

Cytoarchitectonic border with BA9
BA9 was located caudo-dorsally to area Fp1, mainly on the superior,
and also partially on the mesial frontal gyrus. In BA9, layer III contained
medium sized pyramidal cells throughout the entire layer. As in area
Fp1, layer II and layer IV were clearly visible, but layer IV (and to a lesser
degree layer II) showed a less sharp border with their neighboring
layers than area Fp1 (Fig. 5). The structure of layer IV was one of the
most important criteria for distinguishing BA9 from area Fp1: layer IV
in BA9 showed a lower cell density, and was not as broad as layer IV
of area Fp1(Fig. 5B). In Fig. 5B, layer IV is located at 43% to 51% cortical
width as compared to 42% to 55% for layer IV of area Fp1. One reason
for the sharp border with layer V in area Fp1 was the high cell density
of upper layer V (Figs. 5A,B), which was not that prominent in BA9.
The superimposed mean profile of area Fp1 quantified the high cell density of upper layer V, with a distinct peak from reaching from 53% to 63%
cortical width (Fig. 5B), which was much smaller than the corresponding peak in the mean profile of BA9 from 52% to 63% cortical width. A
significant maximal Mahalanobis distance was found at profile position
55, and indicated the border between both areas (Fig. 5C). The described differences in cytoarchitecture led to observer-independent detectable borders of the frontopolar regions with BA9, which were
located on the rostral end of the superior frontal gyrus.

Cytoarchitectonic border with BA11
BA11 was mostly located on the gyrus rectus, ventrally to areas
Fp1 and Fp2. The cortical ribbon of BA11 was very thin (Fig. 6). The
considerable difference in widths of the cortex of area Fp2 and BA11
was accompanied by a more blurred transition of layer VI to the
white matter in area Fp2 as compared to BA11. Another difference

and BA11 on the other was found with respect to layer III. Layer III
of Fp1 and Fp2 showed a gradient in pyramidal cell size from superficial to deep parts (Fig. 6), whereas in BA11 such a gradient in the size of
the pyramidal cells was not as prominent. Layer IV, one of the most
prominent cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the frontopolar areas,
was thinner in BA11 than in areas Fp1 and Fp2, and showed a less
sharp border with layer III as a result of the irregular alignment of pyramidal cells in layer III (Fig. 6). Both cytoarchitectonic areas showed high
cell density in the upper part of layer V.
The border between the Fp-areas and BA11 was mainly located at
the medial/dorsal end of the gyrus rectus and the rostral end of the
olfactory sulcus.

Cytoarchitectonic border of area Fp1 with BA46
BA46 was the dorsal neighbor of area Fp1 on the middle frontal
gyrus. Layer II in area 46 showed a high cell density with a less precise


border with layer III, compared to the layer II/III border of neighboring
area Fp1 (Fig. 7). Layer IV was clearly visible, despite being less prominent with lower cell density than in area Fp1. One of the most consistent
cytoarchitectonic characteristics to differ between area Fp1 and BA46
was the composition of the infragranular layers V and VI. In contrast to
area Fp1, BA46 showed a more homogenous layer V and the intersection
between layer VI and the white matter in BA46 was sharper caused
by the more homogenous infragranular layers of BA46. The border
of area Fp1 with BA46 was not associated with any macroscopical
landmark.

Cytoarchitectonic border with BA32
BA32 was the mesial, dorsal neighbor of area Fp2. The most prominent difference between both areas was found with respect to layer
IV. BA32, in contrast to area Fp2, was a dysgranular area, i.e. layer IV
in BA32 was not well developed as an independent, consistent layer,
and only few granular cells were found, which intermingled with

pyramidal cells from layers III and V (Fig. 8). In addition, BA32 showed a
relatively broad layer II with high cell density (Fig. 8). Layer III showed
medium-sized pyramidal cells throughout the entire layer, and few
larger pyramidal cells in lower layer III. Some of these larger pyramidal
cells reached into layer IV, thus providing a less sharp border between the
layers as compared to area Fp2. Viewing BA32 with a low magnification
revealed layers Va and VI as clearly visible dark curves separated by a lighter curve caused by the low cell density of layer Vb.
The paracingulate sulcus served as a gross macroscopic landmark
for the border of area Fp2 with BA32.


Volumetric analysis of areas Fp1 and Fp2

The average total volume V (±SD) of areas Fp1 and Fp2 (n =
20 hemispheres) of one hemisphere was 6390 mm[3] ± 1351 mm[3]

(left hemispheres: 7235 mm[3] ± 1165 mm[3]; right hemispheres:
6610 mm[3] ± 1566 mm[3]/female: 5858 mm[3] ± 1193 mm[3]; male:
6922 mm[3] ± 1342 mm[3]) (Table 3, Fig. 9). The combined volume
of areas Fp1 and Fp2 of one hemisphere in each brain was also
expressed as a proportion of total brain volume (left hemispheres:
0.51% ± 0.07; right hemispheres: 0.47% ± 0.09/female: 0.47% ±

compared to the entire brain volume showed strong variations, with a
largest range from 0.31% to 0.49% between two hemispheres (Table 3).
Nevertheless, the permutation test showed no significant differences of the volume proportions between hemispheres or genders
and no significant interaction between both. The correlation test
showed no interaction between volume and age (r = − 0.55, p =
0.097).

Probabilistic and maximum probability map (MPM) of areas Fp1 and
Fp2

In order to quantify the inter-individual variability in the extent and
location of areas Fp1 and Fp2, both areas were registered onto the MNI
reference brain (Figs. 10, 11). The superimposition of all ten brains
showed that the frontal pole is completely covered by areas Fp1 and
Fp2. Due to the interindividual anatomical variability of the areas, voxels
in the periphery of the maps with low overlap (i.e., probabilities; blue)
were more frequent than central voxels/vertices with high overlap
(red) (Fig. 11). Therefore, the maps of areas Fp1 and Fp2 overlapped at
lower frequencies. A non-overlapping parcellation of the frontal pole
was obtained by combining the individual probabilistic maps and creating

for right area 10. The corrected volumes are 7063 mm[3] for the left, and

Coordinate based meta-analysis of functional imaging studies reporting
area Fp1 and area Fp2 activations

In order to approach the function of the two new areas, a coordinatebased meta-analysis of areas Fp1 and Fp2 co-activations within functional imaging studies was performed. Both areas showed several significant
co-activation clusters (Fig. 13). The largest co-activation clusters for
areas Fp1 and Fp2 were located on the posterior and middle cingulate


cortex of both hemispheres (Fig. 13, Table 4). Parts of the left angular
gyrus (left inferior parietal cortex (PGa, (Caspers et al., 2008)) also
co-activated with both delineated areas. In addition to that, areas Fp1
and Fp2 showed co-activation patterns which where unique for the specific area. Only Fp1 showed co-activations in left area 44 (Amunts et al.,
1999), right inferior parietal lobule (PFm, (Caspers et al., 2008)), right
mid-orbitofrontal gyrus and left area 6 (Geyer, 2004). In contrast, left putamen, left area 2 (Grefkes et al., 2001), left middel temporal gyrus and
the right laterobasal group of the amygdala (Amunts et al., 2005) showed
co-activations with area Fp2. Coordinates of the activation maxima of the
meta-analysis are given in Table 4. Thus, areas Fp1 and Fp2 differed not
only cytoarchitectonically, but also with respect to co-activation patterns
and their behavioral domains as assigned according to the BrainMap
[classification (www.brainmap.org, (Fox and Lancaster, 2002)). Fp1 was](http://www.brainmap.org)
involved in cognition, working memory and perception, whereas Fp2
was part of brain networks underlying affective processing and social
cognition (Fig. 14).

variability. It is based on observer-independently detected borders
and is available in the MNI reference space, where it can be directly
compared to results of functional imaging studies. BA10 has been
subdivided into two cytoarchitectonically distinct areas: area Fp1 located laterally and Fp2 located medially. The cytoarchitectonic-based map
was used for a coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging
studies reporting activations within areas Fp1 and Fp2.

Comparison of the new frontal pole map with architectonic maps

The localization and extent of areas Fp1 and Fp2 taken together
agrees with the cytoarchitectonic work of Brodmann. The dorsal, medial
border of area Fp2 with BA32 is located rostrally to the cingulate gyrus,
which is comparable to Brodmann's delineation of BA10. In contrast to
Brodmann's map, the present study provided evidence of a subdivision
into a medial and a lateral area based on an observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic approach. The map of Von Economo and Koskinas
(1925) defined in addition to the Area frontopolaris several transitional
regions surrounding this area. Transitional areas encompass areas
“Fεm” and “Fεmd” dorsally, area “Fεf” laterally, and area “Fεl” medially.
Including all those transitional regions into the extent of BA10 would lead
to an overestimation of the extension of area 10 as identified in the present study. Those transitional regions thus likely reflect parts of areas

surrounding area 10. The transitional area defined on the medial wall
(Fεl) also exceeded the gross macroscopic landmark for the medial border of area Fp2, and encompasses the cingulate gyrus, which is occupied
by area 32, and not by any transitional area as shown in similar postmortem brains (Brodmann, 1909; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008; Vogt et al.,
1995). The border between areas “Fε” an “Fεl” described by von Economo
and Koskinas (1925) matched well with the border of Fp2 and area 32.
The present study differs in some aspects from a recent
cytoarchitectonic map of the orbital and medial prefrontal cortex
(Öngür et al., 2003). The latter subdivided the medial part of area 10
into an anterior area 10r and a more posterior area 10 m, whereby the
areas at the mesial surface showed a larger extent in caudal direction
(Fig. 1D) than those delineated in the present study. The posterior
subregion 10 m covered a major part of the paracingulate sulcus,
which is located on the medial wall of the brain (Palomero-Gallagher
et al., 2008; Vogt et al., 1995). The extent of subarea 10 m is in contrast
to a more recent map published by Vogt and Palomero-Gallagher
(Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008; Vogt et al., 1995). It is also in contrast
to the results of the present study, which identified Fp2 on the medial
wall with the cingulate sulcus as gross macroscopic landmark for its
border to area 32. In contrast to Öngür and colleagues, the observerindependent approach for defining cytoarchitectonic borders did not
support the notion of a further subdivision of area Fp2. On the other
hand, the cytoarchitectonic criteria for area Fp2 are compatible with
those of area 10r of Öngür et al. (2003).

Comparison of volumetric and cytoarchitectonic analyses of areas Fp1
and Fp2 with recent human and great ape studies

The human frontal pole with areas Fp1 and Fp2 is one the largest
brain regions in the human brain. For example, the mean volume of
area Fp1 is up to two times larger than the largest areas of the inferior
parietal lobule (Caspers et al., 2008). The same holds true for a comparison with human areas 44 and 45 of Broca's region (Amunts et al.,


1999), and with areas 5 Ci, 5 M, and 5 L of the superior parietal cortex
(Scheperjans et al., 2008). Larger volumes have been reported for primary areas BA17 (23.2 cm[3]; SD 3.6) and BA18 (19.5 cm[3]; SD 3.7)
(Amunts et al., 2000). The permutation test of the analyzed volumetric
datasets showed no significant differences in volume for factors hemisphere and gender as well as no significant interaction between them.
This is plausible since the main functions associated with the anterior
prefrontal cortex are higher cognitive functions, which deal with bilateral input of other association areas (Gilbert et al., 2010).
The volume of area Fp1 and Fp2 is not only larger than that of any
other higher association area in the human brain, but also larger than
homologous areas in non-human primates (chimpanzee 2239 mm[3],
bonobo 2804 mm[3], orang-utan 1611 mm[3], gibbon 203 mm[3] as shown
by Semendeferi (1994) and Semendeferi et al. (2001)). Semendeferi
et al. (2001) reported a volume of 14,217 mm[3] for the right area 10,
which is more than two times higher than our mean volume of
6610 ±1566 mm[3] for the right areas Fp1 + Fp2. This discrepancy is
probably caused by an overestimation of the extent of area 10 in this
study. Their area 10 occupied parts of the orbitofrontal cortex as indicated in an earlier publication (see Fig. 5.1 in Semendeferi (1994)),
which was the basis for the publication in 2001. This orbitofrontal region was clearly part of the orbitofrontal cortex as shown in several
more recent maps by Hof et al. (1995), Öngür et al. (2003), Mackey
and Petrides (2009) and Uylings et al. (2010). Moreover, the mapping
in 1994 was not based on an observer-independent method for defining
the borders, which was introduced only later (Schleicher et al., 1999).
I.e., the volume estimates of the 2001 publication considerably
overestimated the size of area 10. Nonetheless the criteria used to delineate area 10 in the 2001 publication where consistently used across the
primate species studied and the human brain, so the validity of the comparative aspects of that study is not questioned here.
Homologies between non-human primate areas and corresponding
human brain areas were defined according to a comparable topology
and cytoarchitecture as described by Semendeferi et al. (Semendeferi

et al., 2001, 2011). However, human BA10 differs from that of the great
apes by a lower cell density, corresponding to a higher neuropil fraction,
and thus by more space for connections in human brains as compared
to other primates (Semendeferi et al., 2011; Spocter et al., 2012). In
fact, a higher number of dendritic spines per cell, and considerably
more connections to the supramodal cortex has been shown (Jacobs
et al., 1997, 2001). In combination with the differences in volume, this
recent finding was interpreted as supragranular layers of BA10 in
humans would have more space for connections with other
higher-order association areas as compared to other primates. Based
on the higher number of dendritic spines per cell, another theory
emerged, stating that the anterior prefrontal cortex might have computational properties for the integration of incoming information, which
are different from those of other brain areas (Ramnani and Owen,
2004). These characteristics suggest that the human rostral PFC, as a
phylogenetically young area (Fuster, 2002, 2008), is likely to support
processes of integration or coordination of inputs. This feature
might have particularly developed in humans (Amodio and Frith,
2006; Burgess et al., 2005, 2007).

Co-activations of areas Fp1 and Fp2

Meta-analytic connectivity modeling seeded in cytoarchitectonically
defined areas Fp1 and Fp2 revealed significant differences in the
co-activation patterns of these two areas. Our results thus corroborate


previous results (Gilbert et al., 2010) indicating different task-based
functional connectivity patterns for the medial and a lateral part of
the frontal pole. In contrast to the database-driven and hence unbiased
approach of the present study, however, the study by Gilbert et al.
(2010) was based on a database of different functional imaging studies,
which showed activations in rostral prefrontal cortex. The current findings rely on a large and diverse set of studies stored in the BrainMap database that were filtered by the presence of activation foci in the
cytoarchitectonically defined areas. Importantly, reference to such a
large dataset also allowed quantitative behavioral characterization by
testing for behavioral domains or paradigm classes that were significantly
overrepresented among the experiments activating Fp1 and Fp2, respectively. Hence we could show differences in functional co-activation and
associated behavioral domains between two histologically defined regions in a quantitative, observer-independent approach.
Recent studies showed a functional segregation of the lateral and medial part of the frontal pole (Burgess et al., 2003; Gilbert et al., 2007, 2010;
Schilbach et al., 2010). A differential activation of the medial and lateral
aspect of area 10 was demonstrated for the suppression and maintenance
of internally-generated thoughts (Burgess et al., 2003), and behavioral
measures (lateral activations were associated with tasks with slow response times and vice versa;(Gilbert et al., 2006a)). There are also hints
for a possible split into three functional subregions of the human frontal
pole based on different activations to cognitive and emotional tasks
(Gilbert et al., 2006b) and analogical reasoning (Volle et al., 2010). In
these studies, a medial posterior region was described which corresponds
well with Fp2 described in the present study. However, we could not find
a division of Fp1 into two subregions based on our cytoarchitectonic observations. In summary, the available data suggest a subdivision of the
frontopolar region, not mentioned in the maps of Brodmann (1909),
von Economo and Koskinas (1925), and Sarkisov et al. (1949).
The human frontal pole has been associated with many higher mental functions, in particular planning and social behavior. First hints towards these may be found in the classical description of Phineas Gage
(Harlow, 1848, 1863). Further lesion studies analysing the anterior
frontal cortex followed, leading to several theories about planning deficits (Burgess et al., 2001; Dreher et al., 2008; Grafman, 1995; Shallice,
1982). While these studies indicated the importance of the frontopolar cortex for managing multiple, time shifted goals, the present study
indicates that presumably “abstract cognitive” and “social cognitive” processing (and presumably planning, may be differentially processed within
this region.
Our study showed that area Fp1 is functionally connected with inferior frontal as well as parietal regions and, together with these, preferentially activated by episodic and working memory tasks. Episodic
memory as a specific aspect of long-term memory is related to specific events in one's past as opposed to general (semantic) knowledge.
In contrast, working memory refers to the time-limited active storage
of information for further operation such as recombination, comprehension and comparison (e.g. in the ‘n-back’ tasks (Nyberg et al.,
2003; Owen et al., 2005)). Both episodic and working memory form
key foundations of other higher cognitive functions such as planning
and organization of future actions, i.e., typical functions associated with
the frontal pole (Goel and Grafman, 2000). Based on our findings, we
would propose, that these more “abstract cognitive” aspects of the frontal pole should primarily be implemented by area Fp1. In turn, this
region may thus be considered an important substrate for organized behavior, planning of actions and managing multiple goals based on both
episodic and short-term memory information.
Contrasting this “abstract cognitive” role of area FP1, area Fp2 was
mainly involved in emotional as well as social cognition tasks and
functionally connected to the lateral temporal lobe, the right laterobasal
group of the amygdala and the right hippocampus. The laterobasal group
of the amygdala is the largest part of a complex of subnuclei of the
human amygdala (Amunts et al., 2005). Different studies showed that
a major amount of subcortical and cortical inputs converge to the


-----

laterobasal group (McDonald, 1998; Phelps and LeDoux, 2005) and it
seems to be important to assign emotional value to the converged sensory
stimuli (Sah et al., 2003). All of the latter regions have likewise been implicated in affective, inter-personal (Mitchell et al., 2002, 2005) and
higher-order social cognitive functions (Fletcher et al., 1995; Goel et al.,
1995; Johnson et al., 2002; Kelley et al., 2002). We may thus conclude
that affective and social–cognitive abilities, including the planning of future behavior in an inter-personal context and the adequate maintainable
of social roles would mainly be implemented in the medial aspect of the
frontal pole. In summary, looking back at the classical description of
Phineas Gage and the wealth of subsequent literature on patients with
frontal pole damage pointing to difficulties in organizing cognitive planning and social behavior, we would argue, that these two deficits should
have discernible neural substrates. Whereas abstract planning and memory functions are mainly attributable to Fp1 and its network, affective and
social processing is mainly subserved by Fp2 and its connections.

Outlook
The present study demonstrated significant regional differences in
the cytoarchitecture of the human frontopolar cortex. The probability
maps of two new areas, Fp1 and Fp2, are steps toward a complete map
of the human prefrontal cortex based on observer-independent criteria.
The coordinate-based, meta-analysis showed different co-activation
patterns for the delineated areas within the human frontal pole. This
underlined that a detailed and observer-independently delineated map
of the areas may contribute to the understanding of the correlation of
the microstructural segregation of the frontal cortex and its functional
segregation.
The data on the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the frontal pole can
now be used as anatomical constraints for a more detailed in-vivo mapping approach, which might be beneficial for the interpretation of functional neuroimaging and diffusion-weighted MRI studies (Behrens and
Johansen-Berg, 2005; Blaizot et al., 2010; Johansen-Berg et al., 2004).
The referred studies demonstrate a combination of cytoarchitectonic
maps and datasets obtained via functional or diffusion-weighted
MRI as they used the cytoarchitectonically precisely defined regions
as seed regions for their subsequent analysis. The combination with
connectivity-based parcellation, meta-analytic connectivity modeling,
and in-vivo mapping approaches will reveal the structural, connectional,
and functional properties of the human frontal pole in the future.
