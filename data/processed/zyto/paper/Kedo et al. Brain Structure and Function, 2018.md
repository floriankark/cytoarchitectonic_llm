**Abstract**
The human amygdala consists of subdivisions contributing to various functions. However, principles of structural organization at the cellular and molecular level are not well understood. Thus, we re-analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the amygdala
and generated cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of ten subdivisions in stereotaxic space based on novel workflows and
mapping tools. This parcellation was then used as a basis for analyzing the receptor expression for 15 receptor types. Receptor fingerprints, i.e., the characteristic balance between densities of all receptor types, were generated in each subdivision to
comprehensively visualize differences and similarities in receptor architecture between the subdivisions. Fingerprints of the
central and medial nuclei and the anterior amygdaloid area were highly similar. Fingerprints of the lateral, basolateral and
basomedial nuclei were also similar to each other, while those of the remaining nuclei were distinct in shape. Similarities
were further investigated by a hierarchical cluster analysis: a two-cluster solution subdivided the phylogenetically older part
(central, medial nuclei, anterior amygdaloid area) from the remaining parts of the amygdala. A more fine-grained threecluster solution replicated our previous parcellation including a laterobasal, superficial and centromedial group. Furthermore,
it helped to better characterize the paralaminar nucleus with a molecular organization in-between the laterobasal and the
superficial group. The multimodal cyto- and receptor-architectonic analysis of the human amygdala provides new insights
into its microstructural organization, intersubject variability, localization in stereotaxic space and principles of receptorbased neurochemical differences.

### Introduction

The human amygdala is involved in processing of emotions, social cognition, olfaction, learning, vegetative and
other functions (LeDoux 2000; Adolphs 2010; Olsson and
Phelps 2007; Talarovicova et al. 2007; Soudry et al. 2011;

Canessa et al. 2013; Hesse et al. 2016). Since neurotransmitter receptors are key molecules of signal transmission,
their expression in the amygdala is important for its functional diversity. It has been demonstrated that glutamatergic
AMPA and NMDA as well as dopaminergic ­D1 receptors are
involved in different aspects of fear processing (Walker and
Davis 2002; Guarraci et al. 1999; Takahashi et al. 2012).
Serotonin 5-HT1A receptor knockout mice show a decreased
exploratory activity and increased fear reaction to aversive
events (Ramboz et al. 1998). Furthermore, a low-fear phenotype in a patient with Urbach–Wiethe disease with selective bilateral amygdala damage is associated with a 70%
global decrease in the binding potential of 5-HT2A receptors throughout the brain (Hurlemann et al. 2009). Stimulation of 5-HT2A receptors on GABAergic interneurons of the
amygdala and hippocampus lead to increased GABA release,
and thereby modulate synchronized rhythmic activity during memory formation (Bombardi and Di Giovanni 2013).
Stressful events, such as conditioned fear, cause significant

increases in noradrenaline release in the amygdala, hypothalamus and locus coeruleus; this increase in noradrenaline
release is significantly attenuated by pretreatment with diazepam in a flumazenil reversible manner, acting via the benzodiazepine/GABAA receptor complex (Tanaka et al. 2000).
Neurotransmitter receptors are differentially distributed
across the human amygdala, as demonstrated for selected
receptor types (e.g., Cortés et al. 1987; Niehoff and Whitehouse 1983; Pazos et al. 1987a, b). These and cytoarchitectonic as well as immunohistochemical studies on the heterogeneous cellular composition of the amygdala (Benzing
et al. 1992; Brockhaus 1938; de Olmos 1990, 2004; Heimer
et al. 1999; Sims and Williams 1990; Sorvari et al. 1995;
Svendsen and Bird 1985; Yilmazer-Hanke 2012) resulted in
parcellations into numerous subdivisions. However, details
of the maps differed between the studies, e.g., as to each
individual subdivision. Discrepancies regarding its existence, extent and possible sub-parcellation (see Heimer et al.
1999, Tables I–IV) as well as its nomenclature (as compared to the earlier studies, e.g., of Brockhaus 1938; Stephan
1975) hold especially true for the anterior amygdaloid area.
It was not easily recognized, e.g., Yilmazer-Hanke (2012)
and some earlier investigators (see Heimer et al. 1999 for
comparison) identified other structures in place of AAA.
The identified anterior amygdaloid area was different in
its extent between the studies: AAA of de Olmos (1990,
2004) constituted only a part of AA of Sims and Williams
(1990). Moreover, de Olmos further subdivided this area
into the superficial (AAAsf) and deep (AAAdp) parts in
contrast to the latter authors. Sometimes the nomenclature
and classification of the amygdaloid subdivisions seems to
be confusing because nearly similar terms were used for
different structures, e.g., ‘the parahippocampal–amygdaloid transition area (PHA)’ of Yilmazer-Hanke (2012) and
the hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area (HATA) of
Rosene and van Hoesen (1987), but the former is the part
of the amygdala and the latter is a part of the hippocampus.
Most of the amygdala studies, however, do not mention the
HATA. The amygdalohippocampal transition area, which
is a caudal area of the amygdala at the border with HATA,
is also a subject of controversies: the term ‘amygdalohippocampal transition area (AHi)’ referred to the entire amygdaloid subdivision which included a posterodorsal(medial)
and anteroventral(lateral) division in the study of de Olmos
(2004). In contrast, ‘amygdalohippocampal area’ [AHA of
Sorvari et al. (1995, 1996a, b)] refers only to the latter division of AHi as proposed by de Olmos (Heimer et al. 1999).
The other example is the posterior cortical nucleus which
in the study of de Olmos (1990) is comparable to a dorsal
portion of the posterodorsal(medial) division of AHi (de
Olmos 2004), whereas posterior cortical nucleus (COp) of
Sorvari et al. corresponds to the entire posterodorsal(medial)
division of AHi (Heimer et al. 1999). Other parcellation of

## 1 3


the transitional area of the amygdala to the hippocampus
includes from one [Pam Ch of Stephan (1975)] up to 4
(Brockhaus 1938) subdivisions.
Other differences in the classification schemes can also
be found. The ‘Supraamygdaleum’ of Brockhaus (1938)
segregated the anterior amygdaloid area along with central
and medial nuclei from the amygdala proper (‘Amygdaleum
proprium’). The anterior amygdaloid area was included to
the olfactory amygdala along with the subdivisions of the
superficial amygdala (de Olmos 1990), while later it was
considered as a part of the extended amygdala along with the
centromedial amygdala (de Olmos 2004). The paralaminar
nucleus was considered to be part of the basolateral nucleus
(de Olmos 1990; Sims and Williams 1990), or interpreted
as an individual subdivision (de Olmos 2004; Heimer et al.
1999).
In order to address such controversies and even confusion,
it would be necessary to rely a classification of subdivisions
on quantitative and reproducible measures of similarities
between the subdivisions. To introduce such metrics has not
been possible in the past considering the largely qualitative
analysis of cellular architecture without considering other
modalities.
Our previous cytoarchitectonic work has identified subdivisions of the amygdala with a focus on their grouping:
(1) the superficial group contained the anterior amygdaloid
area, the amygdalopiriform transition area, the amygdalohippocampal transition area, the posterior cortical nucleus
and the ventral cortical nuclei with its parcellations; (2)
_the laterobasal group encompassed the lateral, basolateral,_
basomedial and paralaminar nuclei; and (3) the centromedial
_group included the central and medial nuclei (Amunts et al._
2005; Heimer et al. 1999).
The subdivisions are involved in different functions,
which partly seem to overlap [e.g., in form of functional
redundancy of the basolateral and basomedial nuclei in the
conditioned fear expression and extinction (Amano et al.
2011)]. Considering the fact that functions may go beyond
a single subdivision, probabilistic maps were generated for
the three major amygdaloid groups in order to provide a
mean for assignment of findings from neuroimaging studies of the living human brain to these microanatomically
defined groups, and thus, to better understand the relationship between the cytoarchitecture of the amygdala and the
broad range of functions (Amunts et al. 2005). As a result,
subsequent studies showed that some of the functions were
spread over more than one amygdaloid group (e.g., Ball
et al. 2007; Hurlemann et al. 2008; Fruhholz and Grandjean 2013), whereas the others were confined to specific
groups of the amygdala (Fruhholz and Grandjean 2013;
Goossens et al. 2009; Klumpers et al. 2015; Koelsch et al.
2013; Simons et al. 2014), e.g., in the study of Fruhholz
and Grandjean (2013), sensitivity of functional activity

to emotional cues from speech prosody relied on both the
superficial (bilaterally) and laterobasal (right) amygdaloid
groups, but explicit attention to prosody implicated the laterobasal group. Also, functional characterization of the three
connectivity-derived clusters of the histologically defined
amygdala, which were highly concordant to the parcellation
of Amunts et al. (2005), revealed both common and specific
functions of each cluster (Bzdok et al. 2013). Processing of
emotions, and especially fear, is a function which was linked
to all three major clusters. Specific function, e.g., of the centromedial group cluster was related by the latter authors to
mediating attentional, vegetative and motor responses.
The subdivisions of the amygdala reveal distinct connectivity (Price et al. 1987; Amaral et al. 1992; Fudge and
Tucker 2009; Stefanacci and Amaral 2002) and specific
functions in the animal studies (e.g., Amano et al. 2011;
Holland and Gallagher 1999; Kalin et al. 2004). Therefore,
these results suggest specific functions of the subdivisions
in the human amygdala. Fruhholz and Grandjean (2013)
report functional activation within a certain amygdaloid
group in form of segregated clusters which may imply a
more fine-grained parcellation of the amygdala, e.g., dorsal
and medial clusters in the left superficial group, and dorsal
and ventral clusters in the right superficial group, as well
as lateral cluster in the right laterobasal group were functionally involved as a reaction on angry voices. However, a
possibility to study functions at the fine-grained level is still
missing in the humans.


The present study, therefore, (1) provides a refined cytoarchitectonic analysis of the parcellation of the amygdala
and (2) generates the probability maps for further structurefunctional correlations reflecting the intersubject variability
of subdivisions of the amygdala using an improved workflow
and mapping tools. This parcellation is used as basis for
a regionally specific analysis of the expression of multiple
receptors in the human amygdala. The balance between
the densities of the different receptor types is visualized as
‘multi-receptor fingerprint’ in each subdivision, and the different fingerprints are further analyzed by means of a hierarchical cluster analysis, to reveal grouping of subdivisions
based on the molecular organization of the amygdala.

### Materials and methods

#### Subjects (postmortem brains)

Two samples of postmortem brains (Table 1) were used in
the study. The sample 1 included ten postmortem brains (five
females, five males; age range 37–86 years) which were the
same as in the prior cytoarchitectonic study (Amunts et al.
2005), except for the brain number pm2, which was included
in the present (but not the previous) study; the reason was
that, in addition to cell body-stained sections, neighboring
sections stained for myelin (Gallyas 1979) were available in
this additional brain. Myelin-stained sections of pm2 (and

2 consisted of six deep-frozen hemispheres from five postmortem human brains (two females, three males; age range
72–79 years).
All brains were obtained from the body donor program
of the Anatomical Institute of the University of Düsseldorf
according to legal requirements and in accordance with
the Ethical committee of Düsseldorf University and came
from subjects with no history of neurological or psychiatric
disorders.

#### Cytoarchitectonic mapping

**Histological processing**

Cytoarchitectonic mapping of ten postmortem brains (sample 1 of Table 1) was performed in serial, cell body-stained
histological sections as previously described (Zilles et al.
2002b; Amunts et al. 2005).
In short, brains were removed from the skull and fixed
for several months in buffered formalin or in Bodian’s fixative (pm1 and pm9). The brains were scanned after fixation
using magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (Siemens 1.5-T
magnet, Erlanger, Germany) using a T1-weighted threedimensional (3-D) FLASH sequence (flip angle 40°, repetition time = 40 ms, and echo time = 5 ms for each image),
(3-D MRI scan of the fixed brain). The brains were dehydrated in graded alcohols, embedded in paraffin and serially
sectioned with a microtome into 20 µm-thick sections. Each
15th section was mounted on a glass slide, stained for cell
bodies (Merker 1983) and digitized (the high-resolution flatbed scans of the stained histological section).
Every 15th to 60th section was used for cytoarchitectonic
analysis (Fig. 1a, b).

**Cytoarchitectonic mapping and nomenclature used**

The rostro-caudal extent of the amygdalar subdivisions was
manually traced onto high-resolution scans of histological
sections in both hemispheres using in-house software (SectionTracer) (Fig. 2). In a refined cytoarchitectonic analysis, we identified ten subdivisions: the anterior amygdaloid
area, the amygdalopiriform transition area, the amygdalohippocampal transition area, the basolateral nucleus, basomedial nucleus, the central nucleus, the lateral nucleus,
the medial nucleus, paralaminar nucleus and the ventral
cortical nucleus. In contrast to our prior cytoarchitectonic
study (Amunts et al. 2005), we included the posterior cortical nucleus into the amygdalohippocampal transition area
in accord with the latest classification of de Olmos (2004)
based on the histochemical data. Furthermore, the posterior
cortical nucleus was too small in its in-plane- and rostro-caudal extent for generation of the probabilistic map. Overall,

## 1 3


we adopted the nomenclature of de Olmos (2004), except for
his anterior cortical nucleus which we did not segregate. We
mapped our medial nucleus following the criteria of Brockhaus (1938) for his Area perisupraamygdalaris (psAi, psAv)
and Supraamygdaleum superficiale (sAsfi, Asfv). According
to assignment of Heimer et al. (1999), both structures (with
their parcellations) represent not only the medial nucleus (its
superficial and deep part, respectively), but also the anterior cortical nucleus. In addition, segregation of the anterior
cortical nucleus from the medial nucleus would lead to a
problem in generation of their maps due to decrease in size
of the structures (see below, in ‘Computation of continuous
and maximum probabilistic maps’).
Our classification of the subdivisions was originally
based on that of Heimer et al. (1999) adopted by Amunts
et al. (2005) for the amygdala, but excluding ‘Structures
topographically related to the amygdala’ of Heimer et al.
In addition to the laterobasal and superficial groups of
the amygdala, ‘centromedial group’ (instead of ‘nuclei of
extended amygdala’ of Heimer et al.) was segregated on the
basis of included subdivisions, i.e., the central and medial
nuclei (excluding the bed nuclei of stria terminalis to be a
subject of a separate study).
The refined analysis also served the goal of identification and mapping of the internal and related external fiber
bundles in the amygdala in the same sections. The identification of fiber bundles was based on their comparison with
the micrographs and descriptions published by Brockhaus
(1938), as well as on observation of their direction in the
myeloarchitectonic sections. However, the single fiber bundles of the internal fiber bundle system are too small to be
adequately represented at the relatively low spatial resolution of the anatomical MNI reference space (Evans et al.
2012). Therefore, for computation of the probabilistic maps
(see below), the identified fiber masses were merged into two
internal fiber structures: (1) the medial fiber bundles [including the intermediate caudomedial fiber masses (icm) and the
Lamella medialis (lm) of de Olmos (1990) and Brockhaus
(1938)] and (2) the intermediate fiber bundles [including the
intermediate central fiber masses (ice), the intermediate orolateral fiber masses (iol) and the Lamellae dorsales (ld) of de
Olmos (1990) and Brockhaus (1938)]. The stria terminalis
associated with the amygdala represented an external fiber
bundle which was mapped in its ventro-medial part (vtm,
Brockhaus 1938) (Fig. 2).
As compared to the prior study, the classification of the
subdivisions into the three major groups is reconsidered
here (as result of analysis of the molecular fingerprints, see
below).

**Volume measurements**

Based on the contours traced in the high-resolution sections
(Fig. 2), the area values were extracted (in pixels) for each
subdivision in each hemisphere and brain. The volume of
subdivision was calculated as a sum of areas (∑Ai) for all
evaluated sections multiplied by the pixel size for x and y
axes (0.02116 and 0.02116 mm, respectively), thickness of
the section (0.020 mm) and spacing between the sections
(1.2 mm) as well as shrinkage factor for the respective brain
in order to obtain the true values for volume (Amunts et al.
2005). We have analyzed from 7 to 23 sections for all subdivisions in one hemisphere.
The volumes of each subdivision were corrected by the
fresh volume to eliminate intersubject variability in brain
volume. The corrected volumes were tested for interhemispheric and gender differences with pair-wise permutation
tests (Bludau et al. 2014; Eickhoff et al. 2007) and subsequent Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons.
For each permutation test, the volumes were correspondingly grouped (male/female, left/right) and p values were
calculated between the means of these groups. All volume
values were randomly re-distributed within two groups
under the assumption of label exchangeability; 100,000 iterations of calculation were performed between these groups
(p < 0.05) (Bludau et al. 2014; Eickhoff et al. 2007).


**Computation of continuous and maximum probabilistic**
**maps**

The probabilistic maps allow considering an exact topography of architectural details at the macrostructural level
of MRI (Amunts et al. 2007; Zilles et al. 2002b; Zilles
and Amunts 2010). Due to the advances in the processing
pipeline, calculation of the continuous probabilistic maps
has become possible; they are characterized by a further
improved quality of alignment of the histological data to the
in vivo reference brain (Mohlberg et al. 2012).
The three-dimensional (3-D) reconstruction of the brain
was based on two data sets obtained during the histological
processing (the high-resolution scans of the cytoarchitectonic section (20 µm in-plane/pixel) and 3-D MRI scan of
the fixed brain (1 × 1 × 1 mm) were to combine). The borders were traced in the high-resolution scans of the sections
before the 3-D reconstruction in contrast to the prior study
(Amunts et al. 2005). The labeling of the brain structures
in the high-resolution images of the histological sections
increased the spatial resolution of the maps of small subdivisions of the amygdala. In order to adjust for the lower
resolution of MRI data set, the high-resolution images of
the histological sections with the contour lines were downscaled; a box filter was used, which simultaneously assigned
a labeled structure to each point of a downscaled image.
A nested combination of linear and nonlinear elastic transformations in 2-D and 3-D (Hömke 2006; Mohlberg et al.
2012) was used for the 3-D reconstruction of the brains
with the contour lines, and for their subsequent spatial normalization to the MNI-Colin27 reference space, based on
the T1-weighted single-subject template in the MNI space
(Evans et al. 2012). The reference space was aligned to the
anatomical MNI space by linear transformation in y and z
plane to have origin at the anterior commissure (Amunts
et al. 2005).
We applied the in-house Software. Our aim was to minimize the interpolation artefacts in order to avoid an overor under-estimation of each subdivision in the reference
space (Mohlberg et al. 2012). However, in case of small and
superficially located amygdaloid subdivisions (fine-grained
parcellation) a tendency to be ‘overestimated’ in comparison with histological volumes is still strong due to diverse
adjustment, normalization and filtering. To further improve
the maps in this respect, we applied here a global normalization over all subdivisions to ensure that the added probability of all subdivisions in each voxel never extends 100%.
The subdivisions were superimposed in the reference brain,
and the continuous probabilistic maps were calculated. The
probabilistic map of each subdivision accounts for interindividual variability by describing for each voxel of a reference
space the relative frequency [scaled from 0.0 (= 0%) to 1.0

(= 100%) and color-coded], with which this structure was
found in a sample.
In addition to the maps of all subdivisions, probabilistic
maps of the three major amygdaloid groups were also calculated as a sum of respective subdivisions (see below, in
‘Results,’ ‘Molecular organization of the amygdala’). In the
same way, probabilistic maps of the medial and intermediate
fiber bundles were calculated as a sum of respective individual fiber masses (see above).
Based on the continuous probabilistic maps, the maximum probability maps (MPMs) were generated as nonoverlapping maps of all amygdaloid structures using inhouse software. Inclusion of the in-between fiber bundles
provided spatial continuity of subdivisions/groups in the
MPM of the entire amygdala; each voxel of the reference
space was assigned to that structure with the highest probability to be found at this position (Eickhoff et al. 2005). If
neighboring nuclei or fiber structures showed equal probabilities in a single voxel, this voxel was assigned to the


structure which revealed higher average probability in a
neighboring 3 × 3 × 3 voxel cube centered at this particular
voxel in question. In the case that no neighboring nuclei or
fiber structures were present, a lower threshold value was
applied, which was calculated from the average value of the
thresholds required to filter those structures with existing
neighbors accordingly.

#### Multimodal receptor mapping

**Receptor autoradiography**

Different receptors of glutamate, GABA, serotonin, acetylcholine, dopamine and adrenaline (Table 2) were investigated in a sample of six deep-frozen hemispheres of five
postmortem human brains (two females, three males; age
range 72–79 years, Table 1). The brains were obtained
according to legal requirements and came from subjects with
no history of neurological or psychiatric disorders. After

removal from the skull, the brains were separated into hemispheres, which were then cut into six coronal slabs (thickness 1.5–3 cm) and deep-frozen at − 40 °C and stored in a
deep freezer at − 70 °C (Fig. 1c).
Slabs containing the amygdala were serially sectioned
with a large-scale cryostat microtome. The 20-μm-thick
coronal sections were subsequently thaw-mounted on glass
slides, and immediately adjacent sections were used for
quantitative in vitro receptor autoradiography by incubation in different solutions containing specific tritiated ligands
for labeling 15 different receptor binding sites according to
standard protocols (Zilles et al. 2002b; Palomero-Gallagher
et al. 2009). Neighboring sections were stained for cell bodies (Merker 1983) and myelin (Gallyas 1979).
The incubation included three steps: (1) pre-incubation
to remove endogenous ligands, (2) _main incubation to_
label binding sites with a tritiated ligand in presence (nonspecific binding) or absence (total binding) of appropriate
non-labeled displacers (at µmol concentration) and (3) final
_rinsing to eliminate unbound radioactive ligands and buffer_
salts. Non-specific binding was less than 5% of the total
binding. Therefore, the total binding was considered to be
equivalent to the specific binding.
Radioactively labeled sections were co-exposed with
plastic ­[[3]H]-standards of known, step-wise increasing radioactivity concentrations (Microscales; Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) against tritium-sensitive films for 8–15
weeks. After developing the films, the labeled sections and
co-exposed ­[[3]H]-standards were digitized using the AxioCam HRm (ZEISS, Germany) and AxioVision image analyzing systems (ZEISS, Germany) as 8-bit images, with gray
values from 0 (black) to 255 (white) and an image size of
2776 × 2080 pixels (Fig. 1d). A nonlinear calibration curve
was computed to define the correlation between gray values in the digitized images and radioactivity concentrations
of the ­[[3]H]-standards. Thus, gray values of the digitized
images could be pixelwise linearized and binding sites densities (in fmol/mg protein) could be calculated by using the
input parameters (ligand concentration in the incubation
solution, dissociation constant ­KD of the ligand, equivalent
protein weight of the standards, specific radioactivity of the
ligand, decays per unit time and radioactivity of the ligand,
efficiency of the scintillation counter) (for details see Zilles
et al. 2002b; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009). The finally
resulting gray values were a linear function of the binding
site concentration (= linearized receptor autoradiographs,
Fig. 1d). Only for visualization purposes, the autoradiographs were color-coded to optimize the contrast in regional
receptor distribution patterns (Fig. 1e).


**Quantification of the receptor densities in subdivisions**
**of the amygdala**

Ten subdivisions were identified in color-coded receptor
autoradiographs (Fig. 1e) using cyto- and myeloarchitectonic sections as anatomical reference (Fig. 1f, g).
The receptor densities were analyzed in linearized receptor autoradiographs of the amygdala (Fig. 1d), and subdivisions were traced in each autoradiograph to extract the
binding sites densities by comparison with neighboring cell
body- and myelin-stained sections. In order to consider the
laminar structure of the superficial group and the medial
nucleus, we delineated contour lines for the superficial
molecular (mol) and deeper cellular (cell) layers.
For each receptor type and hemisphere, pixel values
within each closed contour line (area or subdivision) were
selected in 2–5 sections, and the mean binding site density
(fmol/mg protein, absolute receptor density) was calculated
by averaging the pixel values across sections.
Receptor densities of all structures (also those composed of two layers, mol + cell of the superficial group and
the medial nucleus) were calculated and averaged across
the hemispheres (Table 3). These absolute densities were
normalized to the densities across all structures (= 100%),
separately for each hemisphere and receptor type (Table 4),
in order to make the highly different absolute binding site
densities of different receptors more easily comparable at a
common scaling.
Receptor fingerprints (Zilles et al. 2002a; Zilles and
Amunts 2009) were generated as polar coordinate plots of
the normalized means of the 15 analyzed receptors to characterize the multi-receptor balance in each cytoarchitectonic
subdivision of the amygdala (Fig. 3).

**Hierarchical cluster analysis**

Data analysis was performed using in-house R-scripts (R
[Foundation for Statistical Computing; http://www.r-project.](http://www.r-project.org)
[org) mainly based on the R-built-in functions hclust() for](http://www.r-project.org)
hierarchical clustering, k-means() for k-means clustering and
_iso.MDS() for nonlinear, multidimensional scaling (MDS)._
For each subdivision of the amygdala, the normalized
mean densities of 15 receptors (in %) were combined into a
feature vector. The Euclidean distances between each pair
of vectors quantified the degree of dissimilarity between the
subdivisions and their multi-receptor balance. A nonlinear,
multidimensional scaling (MDS) visualized these dissimilarities in two-dimensions (Fig. 4a). The grouping of the subdivisions into clusters sharing a similar balance of receptors
was established using a hierarchical cluster analysis (Ward
linkage with Euclidean distances).
The resulting clusters were further validated using a
silhouette analysis by assessing the degree of separation

Average SW), (2) for each cluster in such a solution (cluster

value indicates the position of a subdivision at the border
between two clusters (‘intermediate case’), while negative
values indicate a subdivision closer to its nearest cluster than
to its own (‘misclassified case’). The silhouette width of a

### Results

#### Cytoarchitecture and topography of amygdaloid subdivisions

Ten subdivisions of the amygdala were identified and
mapped (Fig. 5a, b) in their rostro-caudal extent relying on
the classical studies (see above, in ‘Materials and methods’)
and are described here using the adopted classification of
Heimer et al. 1999 (Amunts et al. 2005). Subdivisions of

## 1 3


the superficial group were alike the cortical structures by
having both a molecular and a cellular layer. The neurons in
the superficial group were of various shapes: from roundish and darkly stained neurons in the amygdalohippocampal
transition area to specific fork-shaped neurons in the dorsal
part of the ventral cortical nucleus (Fig. 5c). Most neurons
of the anterior amygdaloid area were small and spindleshaped. They were loosely packed and oriented parallel
to each other, in particular in the deeper rostral part of the
area (Fig. 5c). The rostral portion of the amygdalopiriform


-----

**Fig. 5 (continued)**

transition area showed most variations in cell arrangement
and density, from cell clusters (medial part, Fig. 5c, asterisks
in Fig. 2) to loosely located neurons (lateral part, Fig. 5c), as
well as in cell shape and size. The centromedial group contained small, mostly lightly stained neurons. Similarly to the
superficial group, the medial nucleus had the molecular layer
and cellular layer; neurons in the latter were densely packed.
The central nucleus contained round, oval and spindle neurons, which were slightly smaller and more densely packed
in its lateral part than in the medial part (Fig. 5c). The subdivisions of the laterobasal group had a more compact cell


arrangement than the adjacent structures and showed large,
medium and small cells (Fig. 5c). The basolateral nucleus
(dorsal and dorsolateral parts) contained the largest cells in
the amygdala (Fig. 5c). The paralaminar nucleus contained
very small, darkly stained and densely packed cells (Fig. 5c).
Some of the subdivisions of the amygdala showed a close
topographical relationship to surrounding sulci and gyri and
the lateral ventricles (Fig. 2, Table 5). For example, the anterior amygdaloid area was always located at the dorsal lip of
the Sulcus endorhinalis . Other subdivisions were not associated with any landmarks, e.g., the basolateral, basomedial

and central nucleus. However, even if a relationship was
found, it did not indicate the precise position of the borders.
For example, the temporal horn of the lateral ventricles did
not precisely and reliably define the rostral border of the
lateral nucleus, which extended beyond the limits of the
ventricle for 2.4–6 mm, depending on the hemisphere. The
same holds true for the hippocampal alveus, which does not
predict the rostral border of the paralaminar nucleus.
The basal nucleus of Meynert and the piriform cortex
are located dorsally to the amygdala. Small groups of magnocellular neurons of the former structure (Ch4 posterior
_group, Zaborszky et al. 2008) were adjacent to the anterior_
amygdaloid area and the centromedial group (Fig. 2). The
piriform cortex abuts the amygdalopiriform transition area
and was distinguished from the latter by a narrow layer 2
containing very densely packed cells (Stephan 1975). The
entorhinal cortex is located ventrally to the amygdalopiriform transition area. The former had a characteristic laminar
structure (layers 1–6) and a less wide molecular layer than
the amygdalopiriform transition area.
The amygdala also bordered to the transitional areas
of the neighboring structures (hippocampus, striatum and
claustrum), i.e., to the hippocampal–amygdaloid transition
area (Rosene and Van Hoesen 1987), the amygdalostriatal
transition zone (de Olmos 2004) and the amygdaloclaustral
transition area (de Olmos 2004), respectively (Fig. 2). The
hippocampal–amygdaloid transition area was distinguished
by a narrower cortex and smaller as well as more densely
packed neurons compared to the adjacent amygdalohippocampal transition area (Fig. 5b).

## 1 3


The amygdalostriatal transition zone showed a higher
fiber content and a more heterogeneous cell distribution
than the medio-ventral subdivisions of the amygdala. It
had a few large and darkly stained neurons among masses
of small, lightly stained neurons, arranged in small clusters. Loosely packed neurons were found between the
clusters (Fig. 5c). The amygdaloclaustral transition area
contained cells which were more darkly stained, larger
and more densely packed than in the adjacent, medially located amygdaloid subdivisions. The endopiriform
nucleus (Heimer et al. 1999; Claustrum praeamygdaleum
ventrale of Brockhaus 1938) was separated from amygdalar subdivisions by cell-sparse zones and formed by
darkly stained, densely packed cells.

#### Fiber bundles of the amygdala

The individual fiber masses (icm, lm; ld, ice, iol; vtm) separated the amygdaloid subdivisions (Fig. 2). The icm underlay
the medial nucleus in its caudal aspect (Fig. 5a, b), whereas
the ventrally adjacent lm separated the amygdalohippocampal transition area from the deeper subdivisions (Fig. 5b).
These fibers were united into the medial fiber bundles for
the generation of the maps (see also above, in ‘Materials
and methods’). The stria terminalis (vtm) also occupied more
caudal aspects of the amygdala (at the level of the amygdalohippocampal transition area, Figs. 2, 5b). It was distinguished from the medially situated lm by preferred diagonal
orientation of fibers in the former.
The thin fiber bundle of ld separated the central and basomedial nuclei (Fig. 5a, b). It merged rostrally into the fiber

masses of ice which overlay the basomedial nucleus, and
most rostrally also the basolateral nucleus (Figs. 2, 5a). The
_ice merged laterally into the fiber masses of iol. The lat-_
ter fibers were located dorso(-medially) to the amygdala;
between its lateral nucleus and the transitional zones to the
striatum and claustrum (Figs. 2, 5a). These fiber masses
were united into the intermediate fiber bundles.

#### Intersubject variability in volume

The total volume of the amygdala (both hemispheres), estimated as the sum of all subdivisions, was 3044 ± 381 ­mm[3]
(Table 6). The amygdalohippocampal transition area and
the central nucleus were the smallest subdivisions (total
volumes: 102 ± 36 and 103 ± 17 ­mm[3], respectively). The
lateral nucleus showed the largest volume (total volume:
892 ± 120 ­mm[3]; Table 6). The permutation test showed
significant interhemispheric difference in the corrected volumes of the amygdalopiriform transition area (p < 0.05, not
corrected for multiple comparisons, Table 6). Its volume in
the right hemisphere was larger by a factor of 1.4 than its
left-hemispheric counterpart. However, the p value did not
reach significance (p < 0.05) after the Bonferroni correction
for multiple comparisons.
The total volume of the amygdala was 1657 ± 177 ­mm[3]
in male and 1385 ± 65 ­mm[3] in female brains (left hemispheres: 1650 ± 159 ­mm[3] in males and 1374 ± 85 ­mm[3] in
females; right hemispheres: 1665 ± 212 ­mm[3] in males and
1397 ± 44 ­mm[3] in females). The volume of each subdivision in males showed a tendency to be larger than that in
females, but the permutation test did not reveal significant sex differences for the corrected volumes of both the
total amygdala and any of its subdivisions (p > 0.05). No


significant interactions between both hemispheres and gender were found.

#### Intersubject variability of subdivisions

Probability maps visualize the intersubject variability of
the subdivisions in space and extent (Fig. 6a). The lateral
nucleus was the only subdivision, which revealed voxels
with a 100% overlap, thus indicating the lowest variability among all subdivisions. Variability of the amygdalopiriform transition area and the ventral cortical nucleus
was also low (Fig. 6a). The laterobasal group, composed
of the lateral, basolateral, basomedial and paralaminar
nuclei (Table 7), showed the highest overlap among the
three major groups (Fig. 6b). The paralaminar nucleus
was included into this summary map considering its close
topographical relationship and similarity in receptor pattern, except the serotonergic 5-HT1A receptor (see below,
and Fig. 4c). Figure 7 demonstrates the maximum probability maps for the three amygdaloid groups (Fig. 7a) and
the amygdaloid subdivisions (Fig. 7b, c) with in-between
fiber bundles [medial, intermediate fiber bundles and stria
terminalis (vtm)].

#### Receptors reveal the amygdaloid subdivisions

The cytoarchitectonically defined subdivisions of the amygdala were used as a basis to analyze the receptor architecture
of the amygdala (Figs. 8a–s, 9a–l; Tables 3, 4).
The amygdalohippocampal transition area reveals
the highest α1 and α2 receptor densities of the amygdala
(Fig. 8p, s; Tables 3, 4). The amygdalopiriform transition
area had the highest 5-HT1A receptor density (Fig. 9c;
Tables 3, 4). The border of the ventral cortical nucleus
with the medial nucleus was marked by higher cholinergic
(except for ­M2) and glutamatergic receptors (Fig. 8), as
well as serotoninergic and GABAergic receptors (Fig. 9)
in this nucleus. Densities of α1 and 5-HT1A receptors were
higher in the ventral cortical nucleus than in the adjacent
basomedial nucleus (Figs. 8o, 9c). ­M2, α4β2 nicotinic, α1
and α2 receptors in the anterior amygdaloid area showed
higher densities than in the neighboring basomedial
nucleus (Fig. 8i, m, o, r). The central nucleus had the
highest kainate receptor densities (Fig. 8f; Table 4). Its
border with the basomedial nucleus was clearly marked by
­M2 receptors. Their density was lower in the basomedial
than in the central nucleus (Fig. 8j). The medial nucleus
showed relatively low densities of the receptors (Figs. 8,
9); only its border with the anterior amygdaloid area was
marked by the higher densities of benzodiazepine binding
sites and ­GABAB receptors in the medial nucleus (Fig. 9i,
k). Lower ­M1, ­M3 and higher α1 receptor densities in the

densities of ­M1 receptors in the amygdala (Fig. 8g; Tables 4,

a The paralaminar nucleus was classified as being part of the superficial group in the hierarchical cluster analysis, but has a unique position between this and the laterobasal group; to achieve consistency
with previous studies, and considering the topography of this nucleus,
it has been included into the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic map of
the laterobasal group (see text)

5). It also had higher 5-HT1A receptor densities than the
dorsally adjacent nuclei (Fig. 9c; Tables 4, 5). Its border
with the basolateral nucleus was clearly delineable by the
higher AMPA, kainate (Fig. 8a, e), ­M1, ­M3 (Fig. 8g, k), and
benzodiazepine binding site densities (Fig. 9i) in the paralaminar nucleus.
Not all receptors were sensitive to a particular border,
but merge several neighboring structures with nearly similar receptor concentration: e.g., the anterior amygdaloid
nucleus, the medial and central nuclei showed uniformly
low 5-HT1A receptor densities (Fig. 9c, d). ­M2 receptor distributions were similar in the central and basolateral nuclei
(Fig. 8j). The same was true for the AMPA, NMDA and ­M1
receptors, which did not differ between the basomedial and
basolateral nuclei (Fig. 8a–d, g, h). The basolateral and paralaminar nuclei showed similar densities of α1 and 5-HT2
receptors (Figs. 8o, 9e). The ventral cortical and basomedial
nuclei revealed uniform distribution of ­M2, ­D1 and ­GABAA
receptors (Figs. 8i, 9a, g). The α4β2 nicotinic receptor
was homogeneously distributed throughout the amygdala
(Fig. 8m, n). The borders between the subdivisions coincided with changes in the cyto- and myeloarchitectonic pattern, if the receptor type was sensitive to a particular border.

#### Receptor heterogeneity within amygdaloid subdivisions

The 5-HT1A receptor was heterogeneously distributed in the
amygdalohippocampal transition area, suggesting a further
subdivision into a dorsal (lowest density), an intermediate
and a ventral (highest density) part (Fig. 9d, see arrows).
The ventral part also showed the highest kainate receptor


densities (Fig. 8f, see an arrow). In the central nucleus,
higher kainate, ­M2, ­M3, α1 and 5-HT2 receptors receptor
densities separated a lateral part (Figs. 8f, j, l, p, 9f), and
higher AMPA, α2 receptors and benzodiazepine binding
sites were found in its medial part (Figs. 8a, s, 9j). In the
_lateral nucleus, lower densities of AMPA, NMDA, ­M1, ­M3,_
α1, 5-HT2 and ­GABAB receptors characterized its dorsolateral part (dashed line in Figs. 8a, c, g, k, o, 9e, k). Higher
NMDA, ­GABAA and ­GABAB receptor densities indicated a
ventro-lateral part (dashed line in Figs. 8c, 9g, k). The ventro-medial part of the lateral nucleus was clearly separated
by lower densities of ­GABAA and benzodiazepine receptor binding sites (Fig. 9g, i). In the basomedial nucleus, α1
and α2 receptor densities were higher caudally than rostrally
(Fig. 8o, p, r, s). Higher caudal than rostral densities were
found for ­M2 and 5-HT1A receptors in the basolateral nucleus
(Figs. 8i, j, 9c, d). In addition, the dorso-lateral part of the
basolateral nucleus revealed higher ­M2 receptors (Fig. 8i)
and lower AMPA, NMDA, ­M1, ­M3 and ­GABAB receptor
densities than the more ventral part (Figs. 8a, c, g, k, 9k).
The ventral part of the basolateral nucleus was also marked
by higher 5-HT1A receptors and benzodiazepine binding
sites (Fig. 9c, i).

#### Molecular organization of the amygdala

Receptor fingerprints visualize similarities and dissimilarities between amygdaloid subdivisions and reflect the balance
between the densities of multiple receptor types (Fig. 3). The
fingerprints of the lateral, basolateral and basomedial nuclei
were highly similar in shape (Fig. 3). The same was true for
the comparison between the anterior amygdaloid area and
the medial nucleus. In contrast, the paralaminar nucleus, the
amygdalopiriform transition area, the central nucleus and
amygdalohippocampal transition area have distinguishing
fingerprint patterns.
The hierarchical cluster analysis further analyzed receptor similarities. It offered two solutions, which were nearly
identical.
The two-cluster solution combined the anterior amygdaloid area, the medial and central nuclei into one cluster (cluster of an ‘extended’ centromedial group) and the remaining
subdivisions into a second cluster. The three-cluster solution
(Fig. 4a, b) resulted in: (1) a cluster combining subdivisions
of the laterobasal group (lateral, basolateral and basomedial
nuclei), (2) a cluster with the subdivisions of the superficial group (ventral cortical nucleus, amygdalopiriform and
amygdalohippocampal transition areas) and the paralaminar nucleus and (3) a cluster of the ‘extended’ centromedial
group as in the previous solution.
In order to provide arguments favouring one or the other
solution, we applied a silhouette analysis, which estimates

area. The heat map revealed that the anterior amygdaloid
area was similar to the medial nucleus in, e.g., α1 receptor
expression, and to both medial and central nuclei in α2 and
5-HT1A receptors (Fig. 4c); therefore, the anterior amygdaloid area was assigned, as a consequence, to the centromedial group (Table 7).

Interestingly, the ambiguous position of the paralaminar nucleus in its clustering was shown mainly due to
the 5-HT1A receptor density (indicated by red color): the
high value was similar to that of the amygdalopiriform


transition area and was the major reason for associating the paralaminar nucleus to the superficial amygdala
(Fig. 4c).

### Discussion

In the current study, we analyzed the organization of the
amygdala with focus on its various subdivisions which
show distinct connectivities and functions in animal studies

## 1 3


(Holland and Gallagher 1999; LeDoux 2000; LaLumiere
2014; McGaugh 2002; Stefanacci and Amaral 2002). The
cytoarchitectonic fine-grained parcellation of the human
amygdala into ten subdivisions is the basis for the volumetric
measurements, mapping and the receptor analyses. The subdivisions are components of major amygdaloid groups. Our
previous cytoarchitectonic parcellation into the lateral, centromedial and superficial groups relied on the classification
of Heimer et al. (1999). This previous study of our group


-----

**Fig. 9 (continued)**

presented for the first time probabilistic maps of these major
groups which have been successfully used as an anatomical
basis for functional imaging studies, e.g., the fMRI study of
Koelsch et al. (2013) showed responsivity of the bilateral
superficial group of the amygdala and auditory cortex to
music, with signal intensity which increased during joy and
decreased during fear. A later study found that the ‘smallworld’ network underlying joy can be extended to the laterobasal group of the amygdala (Koelsch and Skouras 2014).


Here, we offer the fine-grained probabilistic maps, based
on state-of-the-art 3D-reconstruction and image processing,
as a prerequisite for an anatomically precise localization of
functional imaging data for future functional studies implicating the subdivisions of the human amygdala. It is especially intriguing to segregate functions of the subdivisions
of the superficial amygdala, which were overlooked in the
animal studies but seem to play an important role in socially
relevant functions (also Goossens et al. 2009).

In the focus of the study, we addressed the organization
of the amygdala on multiple levels: the amygdala is not only
a cytoarchitectonically, but also chemoarchitectonically heterogeneous brain structure regarding distribution of different neurotransmitter receptors. The principles behind this
interplay of function, molecular and cellular architecture are
still not well understood, especially in humans. It has been
previously shown that the lateral, the basomedial and the
central nuclei are separate sites of plasticity in fear learning
(Amano et al. 2011; Blair et al. 2001; Keifer et al. 2015;
LeDoux 2000). In both the lateral and basolateral nuclei,
Pape and Stork (2003) demonstrated selective expression of
molecular factors (genes) related to GABA function during
fear conditioning, supporting the view of these nuclei as
sites of plasticity. In humans, the probabilistically mapped
laterobasal amygdaloid group was reported as a site of
increased fear processing in conditions of induced noradrenergic neurotransmission by the noradrenaline-reuptake
inhibitor reboxetine, as compared to the placebo baseline,
in the pharmacological fMRI study using the facial emotion
paradigm (Onur et al. 2009). The enhanced noradrenaline
signaling in the laterobasal group was suggested to be a crucial factor contributing to etiology of post-traumatic stress
disorder (Onur et al. 2009).
Involvement of the basolateral nucleus in memory processing was dependent on cholinergic (Power et al. 2003),
GABAergic (Castellano et al. 1989), adrenergic (Ferry et al.
1999) and serotoninergic (Bombardi and Di Giovanni 2013)
neurotransmission, as well as on interaction of neurotransmitter systems (Pare 2003; Rezayof et al. 2011). Modulatory
influences of glutamatergic, dopaminergic, serotoninergic,
noradrenergic and cholinergic neurotransmission on the
inhibitory tonus (GABAergic regulation) allow keeping an
exquisite balance in the network activity of the basolateral
nucleus (Prager et al. 2016).
In addition to processing of fearful information and
memory consolidation, the same nucleus was functionally
involved in different functions, e.g., in acquisition and representation of reinforcement value by implicating different
external connections in animal studies (Holland and Gallagher 1999).
The fingerprint demonstrates the balance of multiple
receptors (excitatory, inhibitory and modulatory) which
are involved in all relevant functions of a subdivision. Specific shape and size of the fingerprints may thus indicate
functional specialization of the subdivisions. On the other
hand, a degree of similarity of the fingerprints to each other
leads to their functionally relevant grouping. To address
question of classification of the amygdaloid subdivisions
(a model of amygdalar organization), we covered multiple
aspects of amygdalar organization (in contrast to focusing
on one single modality) and used an approach which is
based on quantitative data and statistical procedures. Based

## 1 3


on a hierarchical cluster analysis we were seeking to build
a hierarchy of subdivisions, and to achieve a biologically
motivated parcellation of subdivisions considering molecular fingerprints. Such approach has been proven successful
in the past for several cortical areas, e.g., the cingulate (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009), and the visual cortex (Eickhoff
et al. 2008), inferior parietal lobe (Caspers et al. 2013) and
Broca’s region (Amunts et al. 2010; Zilles et al. 2015).
Our hierarchical cluster analysis of different receptor fingerprints related to the different subdivisions revealed two
solutions with two and three clusters, respectively. However,
it was not possible to decide which cluster number would be
superior based on this analysis alone. In the literature, both
two- (e.g., Johnston 1923; McDonald 2003) and three-cluster solutions were reported (e.g., Amunts et al. 2005; Nieuvenhuys et al. 2008; Heimer et al. 1999 for comparison).
In the two-cluster solution, the central, medial nuclei
and anterior amygdaloid area formed one group, while all
other subdivisions built a second group. The two clusters
include phylogenetically old, ‘extended centromedial’ part
(subpallial, extended amygdala) and new (pallial amygdala)
part consisting of the superficial (cortical) and laterobasal
groups (‘corticobasolateral amygdala,’ McDonald 2003),
respectively.
Another two-cluster solution comes from neuroimaging,
revealing a superior (medial) and an inferior (lateral) cluster
based on connectivity-driven approach (Bach et al. 2011;
Mishra et al. 2014). However, the quality of their clusters
was different: the superior (medial) cluster combined the
superficial and centromedial amygdaloid groups, while the
inferior (lateral) cluster included the laterobasal group.
In the three-cluster solution, the group containing the
central, medial nucleus and the anterior amygdaloid area
was the same as in the two-cluster solution, but the second,
large cluster was further split into a group (1) containing the
lateral nucleus, the basolateral nucleus and the basomedial
nucleus on the one hand, and (2) the amygdalopiriform area,
the ventral cortical nucleus, the amygdalohippocampal transition area and the paralaminar nucleus, on the other. These
clusters largely coincided with those described in our previous study (Amunts et al. 2005) and were further supported
by a recent connectivity-driven parcellation (Bzdok et al.
2013). The latter authors showed the best correspondence
of their clusters, based on the brain-wide co-activation maps
with the cytoarchitectonically defined amygdaloid groups
(Fig. 3 of Bzdok et al. 2013) as compared to the other imaging studies.
The subdivisions were further evaluated using a silhouette analysis. Silhouette values were calculated as measure of
how stable an association of a certain subdivision to a cluster
is. As a result of the additional analysis of the hot map, the
three-cluster solution was chosen. Moreover, new light was
shed onto two subdivisions:


-----

First, the analysis indicated the intermediate position of
the paralaminar nucleus between the superficial and laterobasal groups. Although the paralaminar nucleus showed
a high similarity of 5-HT1A receptors to the amygdalopiriform transition area and other subdivisions of the superficial
group, the pattern of other receptor types was more similar
to the laterobasal group. The negative silhouette values of
the paralaminar nucleus (grouped together with amygdalopiriform area, the ventral cortical nucleus, and the amygdalohippocampal transition area into one cluster) indicates
that this classification is not stable. Our data therefore provide evidence of a unique role of the paralaminar nucleus,
which agrees with arguments of the other studies (deCampo
and Fudge 2012).
Secondly, in both solutions, the anterior amygdaloid
area was more similar to the central and medial nucleus
as compared to all other subdivisions. It was therefore
attributed to the centromedial group, in contrast to previous research (Amunts et al. 2005). All its subdivisions
showed a medium level of α1 and α2 densities, and very
low concentrations of 5-HT1A receptors. This is in contrast to the superficial group, which showed high densities
of α1 and α2 as well as 5-HT1A receptors. Developmental
studies seem to support this result: the ventral part of the
anterior amygdaloid area showed a common origin with
components of the medial nucleus (anterior peduncular
area, as revealed by Lhx6 gene expression), whereas the
dorsal part of the anterior amygdaloid area had a striatal
origin similarly to the central nucleus (lateral ganglionic
eminence, as revealed by _Dlx5 and_ _Lmo4 expression)_
(García-López et al. 2008).
It has been shown that the noradrenergic and serotoninergic neurotransmitter systems are affected by social
stress and anxiety (Fuchs and Flugge 2003). A pharmacological fMRI study examined responses of the healthy
subjects to social-emotional stimuli under enhanced levels
of noradrenaline (by the noradrenaline-reuptake inhibitor
reboxetine), cortisol (by hydrocortisone) or both (Kukolja
et al. 2008). This study reported a decreased activation
of the amygdala to positive stimuli, but an increase in
the amygdala activation to negative stimuli in a latter
condition. The authors found that the cytoarchitectonically defined centromedial and superficial groups were
most sensitive to the combined action of these two neuromodulators. This finding agrees with our receptor data
as reflected by fingerprints and the hot map: subdivisions
of the centromedial and superficial group showed high
densities of α1 and α2 receptors.
Within the superficial group, the receptor fingerprints
of the medial nucleus and the anterior amygdaloid area

[which constituted ‘temporal lobe components of the
medial extended amygdala’ of de Olmos (2004)] were
most similar, while the central nucleus differed from


both. This finding corroborates a distinction between the
medial and central nuclei described in relation to their
different origin and molecular, gene-related profiles
(García-López et al. 2008): the medial nucleus contained
cell groups of diverse subpallial, non-striatal origin (as
revealed by Lhx6, Shh gene expression) and some groups
of pallial origin (Lhx9 gene expression for the ventral pallium) in contrast to the uniform striatal origin of the central nucleus. Distinct gene expression profiles in specific
embryonic divisions correlated with dissociated functional pathways of the medial and central nuclei, which
were involved in defensive/reproductive behavior and
fear/anxiety, respectively (Martínez-García et al. 2008).

### Conclusions

The current study provides a detailed receptor-architectonic
characterization of multiple receptor types in the human
amygdala and its cytoarchitectonic subdivisions. The latter open a way to link the microstructure of the brain to its
function, dysfunction and finally behavior. Moreover, the
multimodal approach allowed proposing criteria for a parcellation of the amygdala, based on quantitative markers of the
molecular architecture. A unique position of the paralaminar nucleus was defined based on receptor data, which was
classified as part of the superficial group based on a high
signal of 5-HT1A receptors, although other receptor types are
more similar to the laterobasal group. The anterior amygdaloid area was classified as part of the centromedial group,
while in the past it was usually associated to the superficial
group. Thus, multi-level analyses based on a combination of
receptor and cytoarchitectonic mapping contribute to a more
comprehensive understanding of the organizational principles of the amygdala (Table 7), opening a way to parcellate
structures beyond morphological similarities.
