Abstract The dorsal visual stream consists of several
functionally specialized areas, but most of their cytoarchitectonic correlates have not yet been identified in the
human brain. The cortex adjacent to Brodmann area 18/V2
was therefore analyzed in serial sections of ten human postmortem brains using morphometrical and multivariate
statistical analyses for the definition of areal borders.
Two previously unknown cytoarchitectonic areas (hOc3d,
hOc4d) were detected. They occupy the medial and, to a
smaller extent, lateral surface of the occipital lobe. The
larger area, hOc3d, is located dorso-lateral to area V2 in the
region of superior and transverse occipital, as well as
parieto-occipital sulci. Area hOc4d was identified rostral to
hOc3d; it differed from the latter by larger pyramidal cells
in lower layer III, thinner layers V and VI, and a sharp
cortex-white-matter borderline. The delineated areas were

intersubject variability in volume and position. Based on
their location and neighborhood relationship, areas hOc3d
and hOc4d are putative anatomical substrates of functionally defined areas V3d and V3a, a hypothesis that can now
be tested by comparing probabilistic cytoarchitectonic
maps and activation studies of the living human brain.

Introduction

Functional neuroimaging studies have revealed a complex
segregation of the human visual cortex (DeYoe et al.
1996; Malach et al. 1995; Pitzalis et al. 2006; Reppas
et al. 1997; Sereno et al. 1995; Tootell et al. 1995a, b;
Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001; Watson et al. 1993; Wilms
et al. 2005, 2010). A unique area V3, adjoining both the
dorsal and the ventral parts of area V2 (BA 18/V2) has
been proposed by Zeki (e.g., Zeki 1978, 2003). Other
authors distinguished a dorsal (V3 (d)) and a ventral (VP
or V3v) subarea of area V3 (van Essen and Drury 1997;
Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001) (Fig. 1). The dorsal portion
of area V3 in the macaque brain has been described as a
functional unit of the dorsal stream, whereas the ventral
V3 was seen as part of the ventral stream (Ungerleider and
Mishkin 1982). According to the dorsal and ventral
stream concept, areas of the dorsal stream would mainly
be involved in the spatial awareness (e.g., during eyehand coordination) and guidance of actions (e.g., reaching
the objects). In contrast, areas of the ventral stream would
be involved in the identification and recognition of objects

(including their color and form) and faces (Ungerleider
and Mishkin 1982).
The discussion also concerns the existence and the
extent of area V3a along the lateral brain surface. Tootell
et al. (1997) have performed a functional neuroimaging
study and showed that area V3a was located almost in its
full extent along the lateral surface of the occipital lobe,
where it occupied even the most ventral parts. Two other
studies noted a much more medial and dorsal location of
area V3a (Fig. 1) along the posterior bank of the parietooccipital sulcus (van Essen and Drury 1997; Zeki 2003).
Area V3d has been activated by contrast and motion
stimuli (Tootell et al. 1997). Area V3a was identified as
motion sensitive (higher than area V3) (Tootell et al. 1997),
2D-shape sensitive (Grill-Spector et al. 1999) area involved
in the extraction of 3D-structure from motion (Vanduffel
et al. 2002).
Several anatomical studies employing cyto-, myelo- and
receptorarchitctonic methods support the notion of a dorsoventral segregation of the extrastriate cortex into dorsal and
ventral areas beginning with the areas adjacent to BA
18/V2 (Clarke and Miklossy 1990; Zilles and Clarke 1997;
Amunts et al. 2007; Rottschy et al. 2007; Eickhoff et al.
2008). Therefore, the classical tripartion of the visual
cortex as indicated in Brodmann’s cytoarchitectonic map,
which distinguishes a primary visual area 17 from two
extrastriate areas 18 and 19 is not reflecting the organization of the visual cortex. However, even hundred years
later there is no cytoarchitectonic map available that would
reflect the spatial segregation of the complete visual cortex
as suggested by recent functional imaging studies in the
human brain of maps of the macaque cortex.
The aim of the present study was to further develop
existing cytoarchitectonic maps of the striate and ventral
extrastriate cortex (Amunts et al. 2000; Rottschy et al.
2007; Malikovic et al. 2007), and to map the extrastriate
cortex dorsolateral to area BA18/V2 (Fig. 1). In order to
avoid any unproven association with functionally defined
areas and/or homologies to macaque brain, we applied a
neutral nomenclature for the two new cytoarchitectonic
areas, i.e., hOc3d and hOc4d (h = human, Oc = occipital
cortex, d = dorsal).

Materials and methods

Post-mortem brains

Ten human post-mortem brains (5 male and 5 female,
mean age: 66 years, age range: 37-85 years) were
obtained through the body donor program of the Anatomical Institute of the University of Du¨sseldorf in accordance
with the legal requirements (Table 1). The post-mortem

delay was less than 24 h. One brain came from a subject
with transitory motor deficits; all other subjects had no
history of psychiatric or neurological diseases. Handedness
of the subjects was unknown. The analyzed sample was the
same as in our earlier anatomical studies of the visual
cortex (Amunts et al. 2000; Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy
et al. 2007).
The brains were fixed in 4% formalin or Bodian’s fixative for several months: they were suspended on the
basilar/vertebral arteries to minimize distortions in brain
shape during the fixation process. MR imaging of each
post-mortem brain was performed after fixation with a
Siemens 1.5-T scanner (Erlangen, Germany) using a T1weighted 3D FLASH sequence (flip angle 40�, repetition
time TR = 40 ms, echo time TE = 5 ms for each image).
The brains were then embedded in paraffin and serially
sectioned (20 lm) in the coronal plane (Fig. 2a-c). Sections were mounted on gelatin-coated slides and stained
with a silver method for cell bodies (Merker 1983). Every
60th section (corresponding to the obtained blockface
images, spacing 1.2 mm) were analyzed cytoarchitectonically, and used for the 3D reconstructions of the brains.
The methods have been described in detail elsewhere
(Amunts et al. 2000).

Cytoarchitectonic analysis and definition of borders

Cortical borders were identified using multivariate statistical analyses of the laminar distribution of cell bodies
(Schleicher et al. 1998, 1999, 2000, 2005). Therefore,
rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in each
histological section covering the dorsal occipital cortex
(Fig. 2c). ROIs were scanned in a meander-like sequence
using a CCD camera (XC-75, Sony, Tokyo, Japan, image
matrix 736 9 544 pixel, in-plane resolution 1 lm per
pixel), connected to a microscope (Planapo[�] 6,3 9 1,25,
Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany), and a computer-controlled
motorized stage.
The grey level index (GLI) was calculated in small
measuring fields of 17 9 17 micrometers, and GLI-images
were generated. The GLI is a measure of the volume fraction
of cell bodies (Schleicher et al. 1999; Schleicher and Zilles
1990; Wree et al. 1982). The outer- (between layers I and II)
and inner (between layer VI and the white matter) contour
lines of the cortical ribbon were interactively drawn
(Fig. 2d) using a MATLAB based script (MATLAB Version
7.0, MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA). Equidistant
density profiles (GLI-profiles) were extracted along traverses perpendicular to the cortical layers. To compensate
for variations in cortical thickness, the GLI profiles were
standardized to a cortical depth of 100%.
The shape of each profile was quantified by a set of 10
features, i.e., a feature vector, comprising the following

Hadjikhani (2001) (f) and Zeki 2003 (g) reveal the functional
segregation of the visual cortex

A multivariate distance measure, the Mahalanobis distance,
was calculated between neighboring blocks of profiles as
an estimate of the differences in the laminar pattern
between these blocks, i.e., differences in cytoarchitecture
(Fig. 2f). The statistical significance of cytoarchitectonic
differences was tested with a Hotellings T[2]-test and
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons (P \ 0.05).

Volumetry

The volumes V of the identified areas were calculated
based on areal measurements on images of the histological
sections:

X
V ¼ s � T � Dx � Dy � F � Ni:

The resolution of images was 1,200 dpi; the spacing
between two measured sections (s) was 60. The section
thickness (T) was 0.02 mm. The pixel size (Dx and Dy) was
0.0212 mm 9 0.0212 mm. F is the individual shrinkage
factor of the brain, and Ni the number of pixels of the
cortical area in section i (Amunts et al. 2005). Areas were
measured using in-house software in 17-29 sections
through each of the two cytoarchitectonic areas, separately
for each hemisphere and brain.
The volumes of areas hOc3d and hOc4d were analyzed
with respect to inter-hemispheric (side) and inter-areal
differences using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
the following design: between subject factor ‘gender’
(male, female), within factors ‘hemisphere’ (left, right),
‘area’ (hOc3d, hOc4d) and blocking factor ‘brain’. In
addition, the volumes were compared between hemispheres
using paired t test. In all tests, the level of significance was
set to P \ 0.05.

3D reconstruction of post-mortem brains, generation
of continuous probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps
and a maximum probability map (MPM)

The histological sections of the ten brains were 3D
reconstructed using the blockface images of the paraffinembedded brains, and the MR scans of the fixed brains
taken prior to histological processing (Amunts et al. 2000).
All data-sets were registered to the stereotaxic space of the
T1-weighted single subject template of the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) reference brain (Collins et al.
1994; Holmes et al. 1998) using a combination of linear
affine transformation, grey level normalization and nonlinear elastic registration algorithms (Amunts et al. 2000;
Ho¨mke 2006).
Since the spatial resolution of the MRIs (fixed brain
and in vivo reference brain & 1 mm) is significantly
lower than that of the histological sections (&20 lm),
images of the sections containing the contour lines of the
delineated areas, hOc3d and hOc4d were downscaled. We
applied a box filter, which assigned the fractional amount
of the corresponding area in the original image to each
data point in the downscaled image. Downscaled images
were stored and further processed in a real number image
format. Linear and nonlinear elastic transformations were
used to 3D-reconstruct the histological data, and to


register them to the reference brain. The different steps
were assembled to minimize interpolation artefacts. For
the residual interpolation, we used a sixth order b-spline
interpolation (The´venaz et al. 2000). The mean of the two
downscaled and transformed areas of all ten brains was
calculated and superimposed to the reference brain thus
resulting in continuous probability maps scaled from 0.0
(=0%) to 1.0 (=100%). The maps show the probability, at
which each area was represented in each voxel of the
reference space, i.e., the probability quantifies the degree
of interindividual microstructural variability in each
voxel.
The volume data sets were then transferred to the anatomical MNI space, which has its origin at the upper edge
of the anterior commissure (Amunts et al. 2005). The
anatomical MNI space differs from MNI space by 4 mm in
y-direction and 5 mm in z-direction. The anatomical MNI
space has, in contrast to the MNI space, the same origin as
the Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux 1988).
A ‘‘maximum probability map’’ (MPM) of all early
dorsal visual areas was calculated by analyzing the probabilities of all previously delineated occipital area (i.e., the
numbers of overlapping representations) in each voxel
(Eickhoff et al. 2005, 2007). Each voxel was assigned
hereby to the most likely area. If different areas showed
equal probabilities in the same voxel, this voxel was
assigned to the area with the highest average probability in
the 26 directly adjacent voxels. Volumes and positions of
the two identified areas in the MPM representations were
subsequently compared with the corresponding mean values of volumes.

Results

Cytoarchitecture of areas hOc3d and hOc4d

Two new cytoarchitectonic areas, hOc3d and hOc4d, were
delineated in the human dorsal extrastriate cortex; they
were located lateral and dorsal to BA 18/V2. Cytoarchitectonic borders of the region were defined based on
quantitative criteria (Schleicher et al. 1999) in neighboring
sections in all ten brains (Fig. 3). In total, more than 200
ROIs were analyzed.
The microstructural differences between areas hOc3d
and hOc4d can be summarized as follows. Area hOc3d was
characterized by a relatively uniform cell density, which is
reflected by GLI profiles with a relatively local course
(Fig. 4a). In addition, the pyramidal cells in layer III
slightly increased in size towards layer IV. Area hOc4d
was characterized by a conspicuous layer IIIc with large
pyramidal cells, which corresponded to a distinct local
maximum in the GLI profile (Fig. 4b). The thickness of the

profiles were extracted from the
layer I/II border to the layer VI/
white matter border (a, d, g).
The Mahalanobis-distance
functions were calculated for
the block size b = 8 until
b = 24 (b, e, h). Significant
maxima were found on the
positions 38 (a, b), 35 (d, e) and
41 (g, h; P \ 0.001). These
positions, found in three
adjacent histological sections,
correlate with the borders
between areas hOc3d and
hOc4d, which could also be
identified by visual inspection
of this sections. The border
between area hOc4d and
adjacent to the posterior lateral
occipital area hOc4lp was
identified in the same way.
Significant maximum was found
at position 127 (a, b) in section
number 646. This position
correlates with the maxima
found at the positions 145

of pyramidal cells in sublayers IIIb and IIIc. Layer IV was
found at a more superficial position in area hOc3d than in
BA 18/V2. The pyramidal cells in sublayer Va of hOc3d


were larger than those of BA 18/V2. Furthermore, layers V
and VI of hOc3d did not contain cellular clusters typical for
BA 18/V2. The neurons of hOc3d showed a more pronounced radial cellular arrangement comparing to area BA
18/V2 [‘‘rain showers’’ (von Economo and Koskinas
1925)].
In the occipital pole region, area hOc3d bordered not
only on BA 18/V2, but also on area hOc3v of the ventral
visual cortex (Rottschy et al. 2007). The external granular
cell layer (layer II) had a lower cell-packing density in
hOc3d than in hOc3v (Fig. 5a). The gradual increase in the
size of pyramidal cells from sublayer IIIa to IIIc was seen
in both areas (hOc3d and hOc3v), but the number of large
pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc was higher in area hOc3v
than in area hOc3d. Layer IV of area hOc3v was more celldense, and had a less sharp border to layer V. The contrast
in cell density between layers V and VI was higher in
hOc3v than in hOc3d but the size of pyramidal cells in
sublayer Va was larger in area hOc3d. Area hOc3d bordered on area hOc4d along its caudal and medial parts
(Fig. 5b).
The lateral part of area hOc4d bordered on a region
which we labeled as area hOc4lp (posterior lateral occipital
area). Areas hOc4d and hOc4lp differed from each other by
the volume fraction of cell bodies in layers II and IIIa
(lower in hOc4lp), the size of pyramidal cells in sublayers
IIIb and IIIc (smaller in hOc4lp) and the thickness of layer
III (lower in hOc4lp) (Fig. 5c). Furthermore, layers V and
VI were considerably thicker in area hOc4lp, and layer V
had a higher cell-packing density in this area than in
hOc4d. Layer VI in area hOc4lp was more cell-sparse, and
the cortex/white matter border was less clearly defined in
hOc4lp than in hOc4d.

Topography of the areas

Area hOc3d bordered on BA 18/V2 in all histological
coronal sections. The border between areas hOc3d and BA
18/V2 was found on the lateral surface in the most caudal
sections. In the more rostral sections, this border was
located at the anterior part of the cuneus in the posterior
(occipital) bank of the POS. Area hOc3d was located
immediately lateral to the dorsal part of BA 18/V2 (Fig. 6).
Three anatomical landmarks were defined: the superior
occipital sulcus (SOS), the transverse occipital sulcus
(TOS), and the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS). Area hOc3d
extended in part along the lateral surface of the occipital
lobe in close relationship to the SOS. The anterior part of
this sulcus crossed area hOc3d along the rostro-caudal
direction.
Next to area hOc3d, area hOc4d was identified. It bordered on area hOc3d along its full length. Area hOc4d was

located more rostral and lateral than area hOc3d in all of
investigated hemispheres (Fig. 6). It was closely linked to
the TOS, which presents a landmark for the rostral end of
hOc4d. In most of cases, it was interposed between the
SOS and the superior margin of the occipital lobe. Both
areas (hOc3d and hOc4d) occupied the dorsal portion of
the occipital lobe, and extend to its medial and lateral
surface. In the most caudal sections, both areas were
located on the lateral surface of the occipital lobe with a
smaller portion on its medial surface. In the most rostral
sections, both areas always occupied the medial surface of
the occipital lobe where they extend along the posterior
(occipital) bank of the parieto-occipital sulcus.

Volumes of areas hOc3d and hOc4d

The mean total volume (both sides taken together) was
significantly larger in area hOc3d than in area hOc4d
(ANOVA, P \ 0.0001, Fig. 7). The ANOVA indicated a
significant effect of side if both areas were taken together
(P \ 0.05), but no interactions were found between side
and area. Male and female brains did not differ in volume.
No interaction of gender with other factors was found.
There was a tendency of a larger volume of the areas in
male than in female brains (hOc3d and hOc4d), but due to
the large variance the difference did not reach significance
(P [ 0.05, Fig. 7).
The left mean volume of area hOc3d was 2,567 ±
736 mm[3] (mean ± SD) compared to 2,209 ± 897 mm[3] in
the right hemisphere; this difference was not significant
(P [ 0.05). Eight of ten brains showed a larger volume of
area hOc3d in the left than in the right hemisphere. The
mean volume of area hOc4d was significantly larger
(t = 2.8975, df = 9, P \ 0.05) on the left side (1,208 ±
372 mm[3]) than on the right side (975 ± 443 mm[3]). Seven
of ten brains had a larger mean volume in the left than in
the right hemisphere.

Continuous probabilistic maps and stereotaxic
localization

Continuous probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of both areas
were generated in anatomical MNI reference space (Fig. 8).
They were color coded in a smooth spectral sequence from
dark blue (lowest areal presentation) to dark red (highest areal
presentation). The maps showed a high intersubject

variability of both areas, which was particularly obvious in
area hOc4d. In this area, no voxels were found with more
than eight overlapping brains. Area hOc3d showed an overlap
of 10 brains. This variability in overlap is also reflected in the
high variability of the individual centers of gravity as shown
in Table 2. While area hOc4d was always found laterally and
rostrally to area hOc3d, the centers of gravity across all
subjects lay within one standard deviation of each other.
The maximum probability map (MPM) reflects the most
frequent positions of each area in a sample of ten postmortem brains. Figure 9 shows this pattern of areas hOc3d
and hOc4d as well as their adjacent areas (Amunts et al.
2000; Rottschy et al. 2007) in the region of the occipital
lobe. The data were displayed on the cortex/white matter
surface of the MNI single subject template.

Discussion

Functional imaging studies allow the delineation of primary and higher visual areas based on retinotopic mapping,


sections of an individual post-mortem brain. The red line in the upper
left image shows the position of section 1021. Identified areas are
labeled by different colors. POS parieto-occipital sulcus

a non-invasive method used to define the borders of visual
areas during phase-encoded retinal stimulation (see below).
For many of areas that have been delineated using these
methods, the correlating cytoarchitectonic areas have not
yet been identified. Observer-independently, borders of two
new areas of the dorsal visual cortex were identified in the
present study: hOc3d and hOc4d were mapped based on
quantitative, reproducible criteria. This analysis of cytoarchitectonic differences allows a reliable delineation
between areas hOc3d and hOc4d, as well as from adjacent
areas in a region, that was not further parcellated by
Brodmann (1909) and the investigators following him.

Comparison with previous anatomical maps

Brodmann’s map (1909) shows a relatively simple subdivision of the human visual cortex into the three areas
BA17, BA18, and BA19. Our areas hOc3d and hOc4d
occupy parts of the presumed BA 19, and may even exceed
it. Since Brodmann did not report the positions of area 19
in relation to sulci in sufficient detail, and did not

investigate the putative subdivision of this region, a comparison with his maps is hardly feasible. Moreover, the
concept of a simple tripartion of the visual cortex as shown
in his and other studies is obsolete considering recent
functional imaging studies in the human brain as well as
functional and anatomical studies in the macaque brain (see
below).
The cytoarchitectonic analysis and description of Area
peristriata (OA; von Economo and Koskinas 1925), which
roughly corresponds to BA 19, was more detailed and
allowed a more specific cytoarchitectonic comparison with
the data of the present study. Von Economo and Koskinas
found that Area peristriata (OA) was structurally heterogeneous; they identified three subdivisions (OA1, OA2,
OAM). The first two areas are located dorsally, the third
more ventrally (Fig. 1c). The description of von Economo
and Koskinas points towards a dorso-ventral subdivision of
OA although they did not define the subdivisions as areas,
but rather local modifications of OA. OA1 (Fig. 1c, d) may

correspond with respect to its localization to our area
hOc3d, although cytoarchitectonically we identified a
prominent sublayer IIIc and a wider lamina V, which was
not described in von Economo and Koskinas (1925)
paper. OA2 (Fig. 1c, d), in which the size of the pyramidal
cells increases comparing to adjacent areas, may correspond to our area hOc4d by localization. The description
of OA2 by von Economo and Koskinas (1925) does not
enable an unambiguous identification of the areas, and
quantitative data of the laminar distribution of cells were
not available.
Areas hOc3d and hOc4d are located in the region of
Area peristriata cunealis medialis and Area peristriata cunealis lateralis as defined by Braak (1977), who analyzed
the pigment- and cytoarchitecture. Although the cytoarchitecture of Braak’s Area peristriata cunealis medialis can
be well compared to our area hOc3d, the topographic
comparison is more difficult. Area hOc3d overlaps with
parts of Area peristriata cunealis medialis and Area peristriata cunealis lateralis. It can be assumed that the area
hOc4d is approximately located in the rostral half of the
Area peristriata cunealis medialis.
The present study revealed significant cytoarchitectonic
differences between areas hOc3d and hOc3v, an area of the
ventral visual cortex (Rottschy et al. 2007). Thus, there are
two areas adjacent to BA 18/V2, which is in accordance to
earlier observations. Eickhoff et al. (2008) revealed a
dorso-ventral differentiation based on the analysis of the
distribution of different receptor types of classical neurotransmitter system. They have found significant differences
between area hOc3v and hOc3d with higher receptor
density for five receptor types (5-HT1A, a2, GABAA, M1
and NMDA) in hOc3v as compared to hOc3d. Since
transmitter receptors are key molecules of neurotransmission (Zilles and Amunts 2009), this data supports the
hypothesis of a functional difference between the dorsal
and the ventral part of the human visual cortex rostral to
BA 18/V2. Furthermore, dorso-ventral differences in connectivity have been demonstrated by a tracing study of
callosal connections (Clarke and Miklossy 1990). A
‘‘dorsal area V3’’ was located in the upper part of the
occipital lobe, more lateral and dorsal than ‘‘area V2’’. The
position of ‘‘dorsal V3’’ roughly corresponds to the position of our area hOc3d based on the published images of
sections, although Clarke and Miklossy did not provide a
three-dimensional map of this area with anatomical landmarks. The same is true for the border to the adjacent area
V3a. Due to the cytoarchitectonic and myeloarchitectonic
differences authors proposed the separation of area V3 onto
dorsal (‘‘dorsal V3’’) and ventral (‘‘VP’’) part, similar to
the separation in macaque monkeys (Burkhalter et al.
1986). These findings are in good agreement with our
results.

Comparison with functional imaging data

Retinotopic mapping of cortical responses to localized
stimuli is an important tool for the delineation of visual
areas in the brain of non-human primates using electrophysiologic recordings (Essen and Zeki 1978) and functional neuroimaging (Brewer et al. 2002). Given the clear
topological layout of visual responses, the presence of a
distinct retinotopic map has in fact been suggested as a key
criterion for the definition of a distinct area (Orban et al.
2004). A similar pattern of retinotopic organization within
the human visual system was revealed using PET (Fox
et al. 1987) and fMRI (Sereno et al. 1995), and has since
represented the predominant approach to identify the
location of human visual areas in vivo. The total number
of retinotopic representations is still a matter of debate
(Arcaro et al. 2009, 2011). Nevertheless, comparative
studies revealed a close correspondence of retinotopic
maps for the early visual cortex with data from non-human
primates (Van Essen et al. 2001; Orban et al. 2004), anatomical definitions (Wilms et al. 2010), functional

connectivity (Heinzle et al. 2011), or TMS effects
(McKeefry et al. 2009). Based on their location adjacent to
the dorsal portion of V2 and their spatial relation to the
SOS, it may hence be assumed that hOC3d and hOC4d
correspond to functionally defined areas V3d and V3A,
respectively. Area V3d represents the contralateral lower
quadrant of the visual field and if combined with V3v
(hOC3v) a complete representation of the visual field. In
spite of this joint visual field representation, distinctions
between both can be found on the molecular and functional
level (Eickhoff et al. 2008), which may reflect behavioral
advantages for the lower visual field in tasks such as visuomotor feedback processing (Khan and Lawrence 2005),
visually guided pointing (Danckert and Goodale 2001) and
spatial relocation memory (Genzano et al. 2001). The
amount to which such differences are reflected in functional response properties as assessed using fMRI, however, has been disputed. Whereas some authors do
advocate clear differences (Kraft et al. 2011), other authors
have failed to replicate these, and consider the two fields as
parts of the same area (Wade et al. 2002; Zeki 2003). Given
the conspicuous anatomical differences between hOC4v
and hOC3d, however, both areas should probably be considered anatomically distinct yet functionally closely related areas. Functionally, Area V3A, which contains a full
representation of the contralateral hemi-field (comparing
with neighboring area V3d that contains only a map of the
contralateral quadrant), has been shown to be involved in
the perception of stereoscopic (Anzai et al. 2011; Tootel
et al. 2003) and chromatic motion (McKeefry et al. 2010).
The latter study pointed out that there is a minor effect on
perceived speed of motion stimuli when areas V3d and
V3B are activated compare to areas V3A and V5/MT?.
V3A (and LOC) moreover seem to encode figure-ground
relationships and object convexity (Cottereau et al. 2011).
In line with this view, it has been shown, that V3 and V3A
may be involved in the extraction and processing of the 3D
shape (Georgieva et al. 2009). V3A is also differentially
activated by the degree of contour curvature in stationary
and moving forms (Caplovitz and Tse 2007). Other data,
however, seemed to contradict such interpretation and the
respective authors therefore stressed the role of V5/MT?
in that respect (Harvey et al. 2010). It has thus been proposed, that V3A may be involved less in the perception but
rather the prediction of visual motion (Maus et al. 2010).
Given this rather diverse functional interpretations, it may
be justified to acknowledge, that the precise computational
mechanisms and hence the processes supported by V3A are
yet unknown. The concept of a ‘‘V3A complex’’ has been
raised (Georgieva et al. 2009), which is supposedly located
near the transverse occipital sulcus and consists of at least
two rostral (V3C and V3D) and two caudal subdivisions
(V3A and V3B). While the current anatomical definition of


-----

hOc4d seems to correspond roughly to the entire ‘‘V3A
complex’’, the precise correspondence between the variably defined (in terms of their nomenclature and functional
characteristics) functional entities in that region remains to
be further investigated.
The comparison of the retinotopic map for area V3d
with cytoarchitectonic data of hOc3d showed a close correspondence between anatomical and functional definitions, which is in line with the close convergence found in
the remaining early human visual areas (Wilms et al.
2010). Whereas, our area hOc3d corresponds to functionally defined area V3d, our area hOc4d shows maximal
overlap with V3A. Cytoarchitectonically, hOc3d and
hOc4d are indeed very similar to each other, even more
similar than the ventrally located areas hOc3v and hOc4v
(Amunts et al. 2007). In contrast to a previous cytoarchitectonic study (Amunts et al. 2000), we here decided to
apply a neutral nomenclature, and named the areas
according to their appearance as areas #3 and #4 when
moving from (primary) area 17/V1 in dorsal direction
(hOc3d and hOc4d). We do not wish, at this point, to imply
a hierarchy among the occipital visual areas although the
match with the nomenclature of some functional imaging
data is less obvious. Moreover, different concepts underlying areas, subareas and subdivisions, regional specializations, etc. have been inconsistently used in past, and the
concept of a ‘‘subarea’’ is vaguely defined. Therefore, we
adopt the terms hOc3d and hOc4d for the two areas of the
dorsal visual cortex throughout the study.

Spatial localization and interindividual variability

The localization and extent of both areas (hOc3d and
hOc4d) can be characterized in relation to the three
occipital sulci POS, SOS, and TOS. However, intersubject
variability and interhemispheric differences of sulci have to
be taken into account (Elliot Smith 1904; von Kuhlenbeck
1928; Malikovic et al. 2011; Ono et al. 1990; Filimonoff
1932). The the parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) is a continuous sulcus which runs along the medial surface of the
hemisphere from the superior margin of hemisphere to the
cuneal point (the spot where the POS meets the calcarine
sulcus). The POS is very deep and its shape can vary
considerably (straight, X-form, Y-form or arborescent
form). In 96% of the cases, the dorsal (upper) part of the
POS extends further along the lateral surface of the
hemisphere in the region of parieto-occipital transition
(Ono et al. 1990). In our sample, the POS was reached the
lateral surface in all 20 hemispheres. Area hOc3d was
located on the posterior (occipital) bank of the POS in all
cases. This finding is in agreement with the position of area
V3 of the macaque brain; it lies together with area V2 on
the posterior bank of the POS (Gattass et al. 1981, 1988).


Area hOc4d was always identified along this bank of the
POS, but more dorsal than area hOc3d.
The superior occipital sulcus (SOS) is frequently found
as an extension or side branch of the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS). The SOS extends rostro-caudally along the dorsal
part of the occipital lobe and often intersects the transverse
occipital sulcus (TOS) at a right angle. The position of area
hOc4d is comparable to that of area V3A as shown by
Tootell et al. (1997) and McKeefry et al. (2010). Their
studies demonstrated that area V3A was located in the TOS
and the superior occipito-parietal region. This is in good
agreement with our observations where area hOc4d was
found in the TOS, which was seen in 90% of the cases. In
all cases, area hOc4d was located in the region of the SOSTOS intersection. In the most caudal sections, hOc3d and
hOc4d extend on the lateral hemispheric surface, whereby
area hOc4d was always more rostro-laterally positioned. At
rostral levels, both areas moved to the medial surface of the
occipital lobe. This extension was present in all hemispheres, and is in agreement with the topology shown in
various retinotopic studies (DeYoe et al. 1996; Logothetis
2002; van Essen and Drury 1997). In comparison to area
hOc4d, area hOc3d had the longer axis in the dorso-ventral
direction and was found at more caudal sections through
the occipital lobe. This topology is comparable with
functional data of areas V3d (‘‘dorsal V3’’) and V3a presented by Harvey et al. (2010).
The warping of the individual areas to a common reference space eliminates the interindividual variability of
the external brain morphology, but the interindividual
variability in localization and extent of cytoarchitectonic
areas remained. For example, area hOc4d is located along
the anterior bank of the TOS in most of cases, it may be
located along the posterior bank of the TOS in approximately 10% of cases. Another example of interindividual
variability is the location of area hOc3d along the lateral
surface of the occipital lobe. In most of cases, area hOc3d
has an inferolateral position when it extends below the SOS
along the caudal parts of the lateral occipital sulcus.
Rarely, area hOc3d has a superolateral location when it
extends between the SOS and the superior margin of the
occipital lobe. The latter topography was found in 20% of
cases (4 hemispheres).
The probabilistic maps showed a relatively high intersubject variability in the spatial extent of both areas with
hOc4d being more variable than hOc3d (Fig. 8). This
variability is influenced by the large variability of the
volumes of the areas (e.g., smaller areas more variable than
larger areas), but also by methodological factors (e.g.,
elastic spatial normalization). The volume of area hOc4d
was smaller than that of hOc3d which is in line with this
line of argumentation. In addition, increasing deviation of
the areal shape from that of a sphere increases the influence

of methodological factors (registration of the borders,
smoothing and interpolation of the 3D-data) and their
effects regarding to the overlap in the probability map
(Malikovic et al. 2007).
The localization of those parts of the probability maps of
the individual brains, which showed a high overlap (low
variability, corresponding approximately to the maximum
probability maps), coincides nicely with the localization of
the area found in every individual brain. The cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps can be directly compared with
functional activations obtained by in vivo imaging studies,
improves the anatomical interpretation of such data, and
elucidates the interrelationship between structure and
function. The maps are available for download from the
