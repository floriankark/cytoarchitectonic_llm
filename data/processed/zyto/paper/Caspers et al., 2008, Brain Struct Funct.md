Abstract Recently, a new cytoarchitectonic map of the
human inferior parietal lobule (IPL) has been proposed,
with the IPL consisting of seven cytoarchitectonically
distinct areas (Caspers et al. in Neuroimage 33(2):430–448,
2006). The aim of the present study was to investigate the
different aspects of variability of these IPL areas. As
one aspect of variability, we analysed the topographical
relationship between the localisation of the borders of the
areas and macroanatomical landmarks. Although five areas
occupy the surface supramarginal gyrus and two the
angular gyrus, their borders cannot be reliably detected by
means of macroanatomy. To account for variability in size
and extent of the areas in stereotaxic space, cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps have been calculated for each IPL
area. Hemisphere- and gender-related differences have
been investigated on basis of volumes of cytoarchitectonic
areas. For one of them, area PFcm, a significant gender
difference in volume was found with males having larger
volumes than females; this difference exceeds that of

aspects of variability and volumetric asymmetry may
underlie some of the well-known functional asymmetries in
the IPL, observed, for example during fMRI experiments
analysing spatial attention or motor attention, and planning.

Introduction

Brodmann (1909) subdivided the human inferior parietal
lobule (IPL) into a rostral area BA 40, occupying the
supramarginal gyrus, and a caudal area BA 39, located on the
angular gyrus. This parcellation has recently been revised
(Caspers et al. 2006), based on an observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic analysis (Zilles et al. 2002; Schleicher
et al. 2005). Seven cytoarchitectonic areas were identified
(Fig. 1). Five of them (PFop, PFt, PF, PFm, and PFcm)
approximately covered the region of BA 40 on the supramarginal gyrus with extension into the depth of the Sylvian
fissure, the remaining two areas (PGa and PGp) were located
approximately at the position of BA 39 on the angular gyrus.
The aim of the present study was to investigate different
aspects of variability of these areas, i.e. intersubject,
interhemispheric, and gender differences. One aspect of
variability relates to the topography of the areas. Previous
studies (Amunts et al. 1999, 2000, 2005; Caspers et al.
2006; Choi et al. 2006; Eickhoff et al. 2006a; Geyer 2004;

Geyer et al. 1996, 2000; Grefkes et al. 2001; Morosan et al.
2001; Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy et al. 2007; Scheperjans et al. 2008) demonstrated that macroanatomical
landmarks such as gyri and sulci predict the location of
cytoarchitectonic borders with sufficient precision only for
a few cortical regions, e.g. primary somatosensory and
motor cortex. Therefore, one of the aims of the present
study was to provide a topographical characterisation of the
IPL areas with respect to sulci and gyri, and surrounding
cortical areas. We calculated the frequencies for such
relationships as an estimate of the intersubject variability.
Cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps for each IPL area in
stereotaxic space were generated in order to quantify the
intersubject variability in the T1-weighted, single subject
reference brain of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI
space; Evans et al. 1992; Collins et al. 1994; Holmes et al.
1998). These maps allow the assignment of each voxel of
the reference space to a specific brain area (Amunts et al.
2007a; Zilles et al. 2002). Information about the interindividual variability of inferior parietal areas was not provided
in the ‘classical’ brain maps of Brodmann (1909), Vogt and
Vogt (1919), von Economo and Koskinas (1925), Gerhardt
(1940), Sarkissov et al. (1955) and Batsch (1956). Furthermore, the former brain maps represented only schematic
views of a brain in 2-D print format. Probability maps
contain true 3-D information. Thus, they do not only consider superficially located areas, but also parts of the cortex,
which are hidden in the depth of sulci. The consideration of
these cortical regions is important, since two-third of the
total cortical surface spread into the sulci (Zilles et al.
1988). Probability maps of the IPL are, therefore, a more
reliable and precise tool for the localisation of results from
functional imaging experiments in order to analyse structure–function relationships, than the classical brain maps
and the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (1988), which is
based on Brodmann’s schematic drawing of a map.

A further focus of analysis was put on interhemispheric
asymmetry and gender differences in the IPL areas.
Functional imaging studies reported such differences in the
past. For example, attention reorientation is lateralized to
the right, whereas motor attention and planning are more
left-lateralized (e.g. Astafiev et al. 2003; Corbetta and
Shulman 2002; Hesse et al. 2006; Rushworth et al. 2001a,
b). These results are supported by clinical findings: leftsided IPL lesions were associated with apraxia and Wernicke’s aphasia, whereas right-sided lesions most often
caused neglect (e.g. Abo et al. 2004; Blank et al. 2002;
Fink and Heide 2004; Halligan et al. 2003; Jodzio et al.
2003; Kerkhoff 2001; Marshall et al. 2001; Vallar 2001).
The reported results for gender differences in lesion studies
were contradictory: whereas some studies reported differences in neurological symptoms between males and
females in dependence on the extent of the lesion (e.g.
Lang and Moser 2003; Kimura 1983), others did not (e.g.
Kertesz and Benke 1989; Lendrem and Licoln 1985; Miceli
et al. 1981). In healthy subjects, gender differences in the
IPL were observed for affective arousal, movement planning and cognitive control (e.g. Bell et al. 2006; Boghi
et al. 2006; Smith et al. 1987).
Based on these data the question arises whether and to
what extent such functional differences are reflected on a
structural level. Thus, we analysed the volumes of all IPL
areas as one putative feature of IPL anatomy, contributing
to interhemispheric and gender differences.

Materials and methods

Cytoarchitectonic probability maps

The seven cytoarchitectonic areas of the IPL have been
identified in serial histological sections of ten human post

-----

mortem brains based on an observer-independent approach
for detecting significant changes in cortical lamination
pattern (Caspers et al. 2006; Schleicher et al. 2005). The
brains have been obtained from the body donor program of
the Department of Anatomy, University of Du¨sseldorf,
Germany (Table 1). Subjects had no known history of
neurological or psychiatric diseases. The brains have been
dehydrated in graded alcohols, and embedded in paraffin.
Coronal whole-brain sections were obtained using a largescale microtome (section thickness 20 lm). On basis of
MR-images of the brains, histological sections were 3-D
reconstructed (Caspers et al. 2006).
The extent of cytoarchitectonic areas of the IPL was
traced in serial high-resolution images (resolution of the
digitized images: 7,000 9 6,000 pixels, 21.2 lm per pixel)
of serial histological sections using the KS400 system
(Zeiss, Germany), and in-house software (Amunts et al.
2007b). Using affine and nonlinear elastic registration and
employing a multiscale approach (Ho¨mke 2006), these
images together with the labelled cytoarchitectonic areas
were registered to the ‘anatomical MNI space’ as reference
space (Amunts et al. 2005). In contrast to the ‘original’ T1weighted MNI single subject brain (Evans et al. 1992;
Collins et al. 1994; Holmes et al. 1998), the anatomical MNI
space aligns the brain data sets to the anterior commissure at
the level of the interhemispheric fissure as the origin (0, 0, 0).
The ‘anatomical’ MNI space differs from the ‘original’ MNI
space by a linear shift of the origin (4 mm more caudally
(y axis), and 5 mm more dorsally (z axis)).
After registration to the common reference space, the
corresponding areas from each brain were superimposed,
and probabilistic maps were calculated for each IPL area.
The maps indicate for each voxel of the reference brain the
relative frequency, with which a respective area was found
at that position. A probability of 10% indicates a position,
where an area was found in only one individual brain out of
ten. A probability of 100% indicates that an area was found
in all ten brains. Probability information was supplemented

by the corresponding centres of gravity for each probability
map.
The probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of different
areas might overlap to some extent. In one voxel, for
example, one particular area might be found with a probability of 60%, whereas two other areas might be found
with a probability of 20% each. For visualisation and
comparison with functional data, an unambiguous assignment of each voxel to one and only one area is meaningful.
The maximum probability map (MPM) represents such a
non-overlapping parcellation of the human brain and the
IPL, in particular (Eickhoff et al. 2005, 2006b). The
advantage of an MPM is, that it reflects volumes and
locations of cytoarchitectonic areas more precisely than
other methods, which are based on simple thresholding of
the original probability maps (Eickhoff et al. 2006b). The
MPM was calculated by assigning each voxel of the reference space to the most likely area at its position. If two
areas showed the same probability at a particular voxel,
this voxel was assigned to the area with the higher average
probabilities in directly adjacent voxels. If, in some cases, a
definite allocation could still not be achieved, the described
procedure was repeated on probability maps smoothed by
an isotropic 6 mm Gaussian kernel (Eickhoff et al. 2005).
The MPM which was calculated for the present study
includes the IPL areas as well as surrounding areas: primary and premotor cortex (areas 4a, 4p, 6; Geyer et al.
1996, 2004), primary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a, 3b,
1, 2; Geyer et al. 2000; Grefkes et al. 2001), secondary
somatosensory cortex (areas OP1–OP4; Eickhoff et al.
2006b), primary auditory cortex (areas TE 1.0, TE 1.1, TE
3; Morosan et al. 2001), anterior ventral bank of the
intraparietal sulcus (areas hIP1, hIP2; Choi et al. 2006),
primary and secondary visual cortex (areas 17, 18, hOc3v,
hOc4v, hOc5; Amunts et al. 2000; Rottschy et al. 2007;
Malikovic et al. 2007) and subcortical structures (hippocampus, amygdala, entorhinal cortex; Amunts et al. 2005).
For each IPL area, histograms of the distribution of the
cytoarchitectonic probabilities have been calculated. These
histograms are based on the normalised and affine, and
nonlinear elastic registered data of the ten examined brains.
Therefore, they reflect the cytoarchitectonic probability
distribution in MNI space.

Stereotaxic and volumetric analysis of IPL areas

For each IPL area, the centre of gravity in the 3-D reference
space was calculated. Interhemispheric differences between
the stereotaxic coordinates of the centres of gravity were
investigated by using a pairwise permutation test, separately
for each axis of 3-D space. In a first step, the 20 centres of
gravity (ten for each hemisphere) were grouped according
to their origin (left or right hemisphere, respectively).

-----

Between the means of these groups, a contrast estimate for
the main effect of hemisphere was calculated. In a second
step, the 20 values were randomly assigned to the two
groups. This procedure was iterated 1,000,000 times to
provide a non-parametric estimate of the null distribution
for each contrast. Differences between two areas were
considered to be significant if the contrast estimate of the
true comparison was larger than 95% of the values of the
null distribution (P \ 0.05) (see also Scheperjans et al.
2008). Intersubject variability in the stereotaxic location
was quantified by calculating the standard deviations (SD)
of the centres of gravity coordinates for each area.
For the volumetric analysis, the high-resolution images
with delineated IPL areas (see above) were used. Depending
on the rostro-caudal extent of the IPL, up to 25 of these
images were analysed per hemisphere. Based on the
delineations, the volume of each IPL area was calculated as.

X
V ¼ s � T � x � y � Ai � F ð1Þ

where V is the volume of the cortical area in mm[3], s is the
number of sections between two measured sections (60), T
is the thickness of a section (20 lm), x is the width of a pixel
(21.2 lm), y is the height of a pixel (21.2 lm), RAi is the
area (in pixels) across all i evaluated sections, and F is the
individual shrinkage factor of each post-mortem brain. The
shrinkage correction considered that several steps of histological tissue processing such as dehydration in graded
alcohols and embedding in paraffin led to tissue shrinkage.
The correction factors were calculated according to Amunts
et al. (2005). The corrected absolute volumes were analysed
for hemispheric and gender differences using a similar
pairwise permutation test as described above for the
stereotaxic analysis.
To quantify the variability of the volumetric data, the
variation coefficient (CV) was calculated:

CV SD=mean 2
¼ ð Þ

where ‘‘mean’’ is the mean volume of each IPL area,
averaged over all examined brains and SD is the standard
deviation. By means of the variation coefficient, an
appraisal of volume variability in different areas was possible. Lower values of the variation coefficient indicated
higher stability of the corresponding volumes across the ten
examined brains.

Results

Topography of IPL areas in relation to anatomical
landmarks and surrounding areas

The relationships to macroanatomical landmarks and
neighbouring areas were variable among the areas (Table 2).

The two most rostral areas, PFop and PFt (Fig. 1),
shared a common border in all hemispheres. In 9 of 20
hemispheres, PFop was found most rostrally; in 6 hemispheres, area PFt was the most rostral one. In the remaining
5, both areas ended approximately at the same rostrocaudal level. Area PFop often reached into the Sylvian
fissure, but was rarely buried completely within the sulcus
(2/20). PFop always had common borders with the areas of
the parietal operculum, the SII cortex (OP1–OP4, Eickhoff
et al. 2006c), most consistently with areas OP1 and OP4
(Table 2). Since area OP2 was located deeper within the
Sylvian fissure, it was separated from PFop by OP1 in all
cases but one.
Area PFt, in contrast, was always located on the free
surface of the supramarginal gyrus, and occupied parts of
the posterior bank of the postcentral sulcus (Figs. 1, 5). It
bordered BA 2 (Grefkes et al. 2001) in 19 hemispheres
(Table 2). In only six hemispheres, PFt reached into the
Sylvian fissure. In four of these six hemispheres, PFt bordered the SII cortex within the Sylvian fissure, namely
areas OP4 and OP1 (Table 2). That is, in the remaining two
hemispheres additional, yet uncharted, architectonic areas
were located within the Sylvian fissure between PFt and
OP1/OP4.
Area PF was located caudally to PFt on the free surface
of the supramarginal gyrus. Dorso-ventrally, it extended
from the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) to the Sylvian fissure.
Posterior to the caudal end of the Sylvian fissure, the
ventral border of PF was located at the temporo-parietal
junction (Figs. 1, 5). In four cases, PF spread onto the
superior temporal gyrus (Table 2). PF always bordered PFt,
PFm and PFcm, and mostly also PFop. Among the areas
extending into the IPS, i.e. PF, PFm, PGa, and PGp, area
PF was the most rostral one. In the IPS, PF often shared a
common border with intraparietal area hIP2 (Choi et al.
2006) in more than 50% of the hemispheres (13/20).
PFcm was located caudally to PFop on the upper bank of
the Sylvian fissure and ventrally to PF on the inferior part
of the supramarginal gyrus, sometimes reaching its free
surface (Figs. 1, 5). Normally, PFcm shared a common
border with area PF, only in two hemispheres also with
area PFm. Anteriorly, PFcm bordered PFop most frequently (17/20). Less consistent, PFcm bordered the SII
cortex, mainly area OP1 (Table 2).
Area PFm was located caudally to PF, mainly on the
supramarginal and only partly on the angular gyrus
(Figs. 1, 5). PFm always reached into the IPS and, in
contrast to area PF, also spread onto its ventral bank in
seven hemispheres, though never onto its dorsal bank. In
the IPS, PFm frequently bordered the anterior intraparietal
areas hIP1 and hIP2 (Choi et al. 2006; see Table 2). PFm
always bordered the rostral area of caudal IPL, area PGa.
These areas, therefore, marked the border between rostral

and caudal IPL areas, approximately between BA 40 and
BA 39.
Caudally, area PFm was followed by area PGa, which
was located on the angular gyrus. PGa always extended
into the depth of the IPS (Figs. 1, 5). It sometimes covered
parts of its ventral bank, bordering hIP1 and hIP2, though
less frequently than areas PF and PFm (Table 2). Like
areas PF and PFm, PGa also bordered yet unmapped parts
of the IPS. An approximate landmark for its ventral extent
was the caudal end of the superior temporal sulcus.


Caudally, area PGa always shared a common border with
PGp. This border was mostly located in the depth of the
angular sulcus (the dorsal continuation of the superior
temporal sulcus).
Area PGp, finally, was the most caudal area of the IPL
(Fig. 1). It never extended into the Sylvian fissure.
However, similar to areas PF, PFm, and PGa, PGp
reached into the IPS (Fig. 5). In contrast to these areas,
area PGp never shared a common border with the anterior
intraparietal areas hIP1 and hIP2. The caudal extent of

## 1 3


-----

PGp usually coincided with the continuation of the
anterior occipital sulcus at the caudal margin of the
angular gyrus. The ventral extension of PGp was rather
variable, but always located dorsally to the inferior
temporal sulcus. If the anterior occipital sulcus, as the
posterior end or the superior segment of a double parallel
superior temporal sulcus, was connected to the end of the
superior temporal sulcus (which can be found, according
to Ono et al. (1990), in 40% of the right and 52% of the
left hemispheres), this connection between these two sulci
provided a landmark for the ventro-caudal margin of PGp.
Area PGp was surrounded by cortex, which has not been
cytoarchitectonically mapped so far by our own group. In
the map of Brodmann (1909), such parts of the cortex
were labelled as BA 19 (occipital lobe) and BA 37
(temporal lobe). At the caudal borders of PGp, area hOc5
of the visual cortex (Malikovic et al. 2007) was visible on
the same slices, but did not border area PGp directly.

Probabilistic maps and intersubject variability
in stereotaxic space

Topographical variability in stereotaxic space was further
quantified by calculating probability maps for each IPL
area (Figs. 2, 3).
High probabilities, i.e. where a particular area was
present in eight or more of ten brains, were found in a
relatively small amount of voxels. Low probabilities (i.e.
10–30%) were observed in a considerably larger number of
voxels. The distributions of probability values (histograms)
have been calculated for each IPL area and are shown in
Fig. 4.
The probability maps and their corresponding probability distributions reflect the interindividual variability of
the respective area. In all IPL areas except for right PFop,
voxels with an overlap of at least 80% were observed in
both hemispheres (Fig. 4), i.e. the respective area was
located in at least eight of ten brains in these voxels. An
exception was found for area PFop in the right hemisphere,
which only reached a maximal overlap of 60% (Fig. 4b). In
the left hemisphere, only area PF and in the right hemisphere, only areas PF, PFm, PGa, and PGp reached an
overlap of 100% in a few voxels, i.e. in a magnitude of a
few hundred voxels (cf. Figs. 2, 3, 4). The probability
distributions of the IPL areas in the left hemisphere
resembled each other more than those in the right
hemisphere.
Although all IPL areas showed a considerable variability,
they differed between each other in degree. Larger areas,
like PF, PFm, PGa, and PGp, showed less variability (i.e.
more overlap at high probabilities) than smaller areas, like
PFop, PFt, and PFcm (see Fig. 4).

The considerable amount of intersubject variability
caused an overlap between probability maps of neighbouring areas. One and the same voxel in the MNI
reference space can be occupied by the probability maps of
two adjacent areas, in particular by their low probability
parts. In order to account for such overlap and to achieve
an unambiguous presentation of different cytoarchitectonic
probability maps, an MPM has been calculated for all IPL
and surrounding areas (Fig. 5).
The MPM is a tool to visualise the topographical relationships between the IPL areas and to surrounding areas as
the primary and secondary somatosensory cortex (areas 3a,
3b, 1, BA 2, OP1–OP4), intraparietal areas hIP1 and hIP2,
and extrastriate area hOc5. The centres of gravity of the
areas in the MPM were located within one standard deviation of the centres of gravity of the respective probability
maps (Table 3; see also Eickhoff et al. 2005).
Another aspect of the interindividual variability was
related to the stereotaxic coordinates of the IPL areas.
Hereby, the most interesting values were the y coordinates
and their variation, as the IPL areas were mainly ordered in
a rostro-caudal sequence, i.e. showed differences in their y
values (Fig. 6).
Accordingly, the results of pairwise permutation test for
the stereotaxic coordinates showed significant differences
between most of the areas in the y values (P \ 0.05). Only
the y coordinates of the two ventral areas, PFop and PFcm,
did not differ significantly from those of their dorsal
neighbours (areas PFt and PF, respectively). However,
PFop and PFt on the one hand, and PFcm and PF on the
other hand were arranged in a ventro-dorsal sequence, and
their z coordinates differed between each other (P \ 0.05).
The variability of the stereotaxic coordinates as judged by
SD was comparable for x, y, and z values (see Fig. 6a, b for
x, and y coordinates). Comparing the variability of the
coordinates in all IPL areas, no significant difference was
found either; the stereotaxic location of all IPL areas was
relatively stable in all spatial directions.

Volumetric analysis

Intersubject variability

Another aspect of variability was approached by comparing the volumes of the cytoarchitectonic areas. The
volumes of all IPL areas varied considerably between
different brains, for both smaller (areas PFop, PFt, and
PFcm) and larger areas (areas PF, PFm, PGa, and PGp;
Table 4).
As an example of a larger area, the volume of area PF
varied between 1,510 and 4,420 mm[3] in the left, and
between 1,449 and 3,245 mm[3] in the right hemisphere.

variation coefficients of 0.23 and 0.25 in left and right

the right and PFcm in the left hemisphere with a variation
coefficient of 0.51 (Table 4). The results showed that the
volumes of the smaller areas tended to be more variable
than those of the larger areas, which were more stable, at
least for the mean volumes, irrespective of gender or
gender–side interaction.

Gender and interhemispheric differences

The volumes were further tested for significant gender
differences and hemispheric asymmetry (Fig. 7). The
permutation test showed that area PFcm, which was
located in the Sylvian fissure, differed significantly
between males and females with male PFcm having a
larger volume than female PFcm by a factor of 1.8
(P \ 0.001). At the same time, the mean total volume of
male brains in this study was larger than that of female

## 1 3


brains by a factor of 1.2 (Amunts et al. 2007b). Thus, the
gender difference in area PFcm was greater than expected
on the basis of brain size alone. For area PFm, the volumes in male brains were also significantly larger than in
female brains (P \ 0.05; factor 1.3). This difference,
however, resembled that of brain size. The gender specific
volume data, separately for left and right hemispheres, are
given in Table 5.
The IPL areas of the left and the right hemispheres did
not differ between each other in volume (Fig. 7).
The gender- and hemisphere-specific variation coefficients are shown in Fig. 7b. With a few exceptions, the
larger areas tended to be less variable than the smaller
ones, irrespective of gender or hemisphere. However, the
variation coefficient for the volume of female PFop in left
hemispheres, an example of a smaller area, was relatively
small, whereas the variation coefficients for the volume of
male PGp and female PF in the left hemisphere, as
examples of larger areas, showed high values.

Discussion

The present study was focused on different aspects of intersubject variability of cytoarchitectonic areas on the
human inferior parietal lobule. It provided an analysis of
the topographical relationship of the areas to each other, to
neighbouring cortical areas as well as to macroanatomical
landmarks such as the intraparietal sulcus and the Sylvian
fissure. Probabilistic maps of all IPL areas quantified the
intersubject variability in the anatomical MNI reference
space. Hence, cytoarchitectonic data of the IPL are now
available in a format, which can directly be matched to the
results of in vivo functional neuroimaging studies. Structural–functional comparisons provide the opportunity to
understand the intersubject variability, which has been
measured during functional imaging experiments involving
the parietal lobe (e.g. Chung et al. 2007; Tzourio-Mazoyer

## 1 3


et al. 2004; Sugiura et al. 2007; Vesia et al. 2006), in more
detail. Gender and hemispheric differences for volumetric
as well as for stereotaxic data are features, which may
contribute to anatomical intersubject variability.

Intersubject topographical differences

The macrostructure of the brain, i.e. the pattern of sulci and
gyri, and its relationship to the borders of cortical areas
may vary independently. Macroanatomical landmarks of
the IPL represent in some, but not all cases an estimate of
the position of a cytoarchitectonic area. Several parietal
areas seemed to ‘prefer’ certain areal neighbours and sulci.
The four large areas on the free inferior parietal surface
(areas PF, PFm, PGa, and PGp), for example, always
reached the IPS. Thus, the IPS marked the approximate
position of the dorsal border of these areas. Areas hIP1 and

hIP2 (Choi et al. 2006), two areas of the anterior IPS,
shared frequently, but not always a common border with
areas PF, PFm, and PGa. The rostral areas PFop, PFt, PF,


and PFcm bordered areas OP1–4 of the parietal operculum
and the SII cortex (Eickhoff et al. 2006c), but the exact
neighbourhood relationships were variable. Area PFop, for
example, had common borders with all SII areas, whereas
PF only bordered OP1. PFt, on the other hand, was the
‘preferred’ neighbour of BA2 (Grefkes et al. 2001), connecting the IPL with the somatosensory cortex in the
postcentral sulcus.
The Sylvian fissure was a reliable landmark for the
ventral extent of the IPL areas. Areas PFop and PFcm were
located within the Sylvian fissure; their extent into the
dorsal bank of the Sylvian fissure, however, was variable.
None of the IPL areas ever reached the insular cortex.
The caudal IPL areas, PGa and PGp, were surrounded
by cortex which has not been cytoarchitectonically mapped
yet: PGp was found in close proximity to the extrastriate
area hOc5 (Malikovic et al. 2007), but another region, yet
unmapped, was located between them (Fig. 5). Areas PGa
and PGp bordered ventrally uncharted areas at the junction
between temporal, parietal and occipital cortex, corresponding to areas 37 and 19 in the map of Brodmann
(1909).
The PF and PG areas were mainly located on the
supramarginal and the angular gyrus, respectively, but the
exact borders between the rostral and caudal part of the IPL
could not be identified by pure macroscopical inspection.
The border between PFm and PGa were located in some
hemispheres within the primary intermediate sulcus
(Jenssen sulcus). However, this sulcus was highly variable
across the examined brains. The Jenssen sulcus was not
present in all examined brains which is in accordance with
the literature (Ono et al. 1990); where no Jenssen sulcus
was found, the border between rostral and caudal IPL was
found either on the free surface of the IPL or in unnamed
sulci between supramargnial and angular gyrus (according
to Ono et al. 1990). The bipartite parcellation into a rostral
area 40 and a caudal area 39, as supposed by Brodmann
(1909), was not fully supported by our findings. The
differentiation between rostral and caudal IPL was just
partially possible by allocating the areas to the supramarginal or angular gyrus. The exact localisation was only
possible by microscopical inspection.

Cytoarchitectonical probability maps and variability
in stereotaxic space

Intersubject variability in stereotaxic space may be caused
by the following factors: the IPL areas belong to association areas for which variability can be assumed to be higher
than for primary cortical areas. Fischl et al. (2007) showed
that higher order cortical areas exhibited more variability
than primary and secondary cortical areas, using the cortical folding pattern as a predictor for the variability of an

area. The primary cortical areas were best predictable from
the corresponding cortical folds and least variable, whereas
higher order cortical areas were least predictable and more
variable (Fischl et al. 2007).
Another factor influencing intersubject variability is the
size of an area. The intersubject variability in the intraparietal areas hIP1 and hIP2 (Choi et al. 2006), for example,
was higher than that of area 7A of the superior parietal
cortex (Scheperjans et al. 2008). But areas hIP1 and hIP2
were also smaller than area 7A. The same was true for the
relatively small area hOc5 (Malikovic et al. 2007) of the
extrastriate cortex as compared to V1, the primary visual
cortex (Amunts et al. 2000). In addition, the smaller areas
(hIP1, hIP2, hOc5) seem to be located in brain regions,
where the macroanatomical variability is more pronounced
as compared to those regions where some of the larger
areas (7A, V1) were found.
Since all IPL areas were higher order cortical areas,
the size argument, and not the role in cortical hierarchies
seems to be a significant factor, although subtle and yet
unknown differences in the hierarchy of the IPL areas,
which may interact with the size of the areas cannot be
ruled out. The intersubject variability as estimated by the
distributions of overlap in the probability maps of the
IPL areas mostly resembled those of the somatosensory
areas BA 2 (Grefkes et al. 2001) and OP1–OP4 (Eickhoff et al. 2006a) as well as the ventral extrastriate
cortex (areas hOc3v, hOc4v; Rottschy et al. 2007). Intersubject variability of IPL areas was higher than that of
the allocortical structures amygdala, hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex, which showed a high amount of
voxels with probabilities of 90 or 100% (Amunts et al.
2005).

Volumetric interhemispheric and gender asymmetries

The volumetric analysis presented in this study was performed on cytoarchitectonically defined areas, delineated
in ten human post-mortem brains. The study of Eidelberg
and Galaburda (1984) used a comparable cytoarchitectonic
approach. The authors identified four different cytoarchitectonic areas on the free surface of the human IPL, which
were arranged in a rostro-caudal sequence: PF (*BA 40),
PFG (transition between rostral (BA 40) and caudal (BA
39) IPL, PG (*BA 39) and OPG (transition to occipital
lobe). They analysed the volumes of two of the areas (i.e.
the caudal areas PG and OPG) in a sample of eight brains,
whereby no significant interhemispheric differences were
found. Topographically, these areas approximately match
our areas PGa and PGp, which also did not show significant
volume differences between left and right hemispheres.
Thus, the cytoarchitectonic study of Eidelberg and
Galaburda is in accordance with our findings of interhemispheric symmetry of caudal IPL areas in volume. Our
study has added findings for the rostral areas, where no
interhemispheric differences have been found either.
Gender asymmetries have not been analysed in the study of
Eidelberg and Galaburda.
To interpret the functional significance of gender differences and interhemispheric asymmetry, imaging studies
in healthy volunteers and clinical observations in patients
provide further support. We found a significant gender
difference for area PFcm, located in the caudal part of the
Sylvian fissure which was significantly larger in males than
in females. Clinical studies showed that left-hemispheric
lesions in this particular region may cause Wernicke’s and
primary progressive aphasia, as the whole language-system


-----

is mostly left-lateralized (e.g. Amici et al. 2006; GornoTempini et al. 2004; Mesulam 2001; Ojemann 1979).
Whereas interhemispheric cytoarchitectonic asymmetries
have been found in the anterior language region (Amunts
et al. 1999; Galaburda and Geschwind 1980), such differences for the posterior language region including
Wernicke’s region are sparser (e.g. Witelson and Kigar
1992).
The results of lesion studies concerning gender differences are contradictory: some studies report such
differences in the perisylvian region, where men showed
more extended lesions in this posterior language area (Lang
and Moser 2003). Another study showed that women with
primary progressive aphasia were more impaired in speech
production than men (Rogalski et al. 2007). A comparable
result was found for stroke patients, where women showed
aphasic symptoms significantly more frequently than men
(Di Carlo et al. 2003). Other studies in aphasics, in contrast,
did not find a male or female dominance in this languagerelated area (e.g. Godefroy et al. 2002; Pedersen et al.
2004). The reported functional gender differences may be
correlated with our observed anatomical asymmetry for
area PFcm. Further studies, which correlate the anatomical
probability maps of the IPL areas with functional imaging
data, are needed in order to investigate possible functional
correlates concerning these gender differences.
The IPL is involved in different cognitive functions,
involving different fronto-parietal and parieto-occipital
networks. Some of them show gender and/or hemispheric
differences, part of which can be explained by cytoarchitectonic differences (e.g. volume of PFcm). A further
approach to investigate interhemispheric cytoarchitectonic
differences and their impact on brain function is the application of the cytoarchitectonic stereotaxic maps in functional
imaging studies analysing the involvement of IPL areas in
different experimental setups, e.g. spatial attention, motor
planning and language-related tasks. Further clues may be
expected from emerging techniques for analysing anatomical and effective connectivity in the human brain by means of
diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) and dynamic causal modelling (DCM), respectively (Friston et al. 2003, Behrens and
Johansen-Berg 2005). Considering that function and cytoarchitecture of the parietal cortex cannot be analysed in one
and the same human brain, such inter-modal data integration
by means of probabilistic atlases represents currently the
most straightforward tool for the analysis of the structure–
function correspondences in the human brain (Toga et al.
2006). The probability maps of all IPL areas, together with a
software tool (Eickhoff et al. 2005) for their integration into
the widely used functional image analysis software packages
SPM, FSL, and AFNI, are freely available to all researchers
