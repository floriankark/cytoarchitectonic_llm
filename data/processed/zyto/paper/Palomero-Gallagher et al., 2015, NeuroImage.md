Introduction


Human subgenual anterior cingulate cortex (sACC) is involved in affective experiences and fear processing. Functional neuroimaging studies view it as a homogeneous cortical entity. However, sACC comprises several distinct
cyto- and receptorarchitectonical areas: 25, s24, s32, and the ventral portion of area 33. Thus, we hypothesized
that the areas may also be connectionally and functionally distinct. We performed structural post mortem and
functional in vivo analyses. We computed probabilistic maps of each area based on cytoarchitectonical analysis
of ten post mortem brains. Maps, publicly available via the JuBrain atlas and the Anatomy Toolbox, were used
to define seed regions of task-dependent functional connectivity profiles and quantitative functional decoding.
sACC areas presented distinct co-activation patterns within widespread networks encompassing cortical and
subcortical regions. They shared common functional domains related to emotion, perception and cognition. A
more specific analysis of these domains revealed an association of s24 with sadness, and of s32 with fear processing. Both areas were activated during taste evaluation, and co-activated with the amygdala, a key node of the affective network. s32 co-activated with areas of the executive control network, and was associated with tasks
probing cognition in which stimuli did not have an emotional component. Area 33 was activated by painful stimuli, and co-activated with areas of the sensorimotor network. These results support the concept of a connectional
and functional specificity of the cyto- and receptorarchitectonically defined areas within the sACC, which can no
longer be seen as a structurally and functionally homogeneous brain region.

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), a cytoarchitectonically heterogeneous region surrounding the genu of the corpus callosum, can be
divided into subgenual (sACC) and pregenual (pACC) subregions
(Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008). While in functional imaging
studies most investigators considered sACC to be synonymous with
Brodmann's area 25, cyto- and receptorarchitectonical studies demonstrated that sACC also comprises areas s24 and s32, as well as the
most ventral portion of area 33 (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008).
Agranular area 25 has a relatively primitive laminar cytoarchitecture,
with broad and poorly differentiated layers II–III and large and densely
packed layer V neurons that intermingle with the multipolar cells of
layer VI. Area s24 is also agranular, with a thin layer II, larger pyramids

in layers IIIa/b than those found in IIIc, a prominent cell-dense layer Va
and a neuron-sparse layer Vb. Area s32 is dysgranular, its layers Va and
VI appear as a pair of distinct thin layers separated by a cell sparse layer
Vb. Layer II of s32 is particularly conspicuous because it shows a subdivision into a superficial, densely packed layer IIa, and a layer IIb, with
less densely packed, lancet shaped pyramids (Palomero-Gallagher
et al., 2008).
In healthy human volunteers, activations within sACC occur in functional neuroimaging experiments with transient sadness induced either
by recalling negative autobiographical experiences, or by sensoryaffective stimulation such as “sad pictures” or mournful music (George
et al., 1995; Kross et al., 2009; Smith et al., 2011). Furthermore, sACC activations were larger when participants specifically facilitated ruminative behavior during recall of negative autobiographical memories as
opposed to a condition where persistence of rumination was actively
inhibited (Kross et al., 2009). In turn, activation of sACC was not seen
during the recall of happy memories (George et al., 1995). Information


-----

concerning the function of a specific area within sACC is only available
for area 25, which has been implicated in the regulation of autonomic
and endocrine functions via connections with the periaqueductal gray
(An et al., 1998; Chiba et al., 2001; Freedman et al., 2000; Neafsey
et al., 1993; Takagishi and Chiba, 1991).
Meta-analyses have confirmed the involvement of sACC in the processing of affective experiences associated with sadness (Phan et al.,
2002; Vogt, 2005), as well as during the down-regulation of negative affective responses resulting in fear extinction (Diekhof et al., 2011). They
have also revealed that sACC is activated during affective pain processing, in particular when related to noxious cutaneous stimuli (Duerden
and Albanese, 2013; Vogt, 2005). Additionally, sACC is part of a network
enabling the integration of cognitive control and affective processes
(Cromheeke and Mueller, 2014). That is, sACC is activated when a cognitive control task is carried out in an emotion-generating context, or
the emotional stimuli are relevant to the cognitive task being carried
out (Cromheeke and Mueller, 2014). However, these studies did not
take the parcellation of sACC into architectonically distinct areas into
consideration when describing the location of activation foci. Thus,
sACC conceptually remained a homogeneous brain region despite a conspicuous functional diversity and the fact that the centers of activity
were frequently seen at different positions. This concept of a homogeneous region challenges the widely accepted hypothesis of structural–
functional relationships at the level of cortical areas.
Therefore, a multimodal analysis taking into consideration both cellular and receptor compositions as well as the connectivity and functions is necessary to reconsider the concept of a homogeneous sACC in
functional neuroimaging studies. Here we will provide a detailed comparison of previously cyto- and receptorarchitectonically characterized
areas 33, 25, s24, and s32 (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008) with the
highly variable sulcal and gyral patterns in the region of the sACC. We
will generate three-dimensional (3D)-probabilistic maps of these
areas in standard stereotaxic reference space, which enable quantification of their intersubject variability in position and extent. These maps
will also serve as volumes of interest for an analysis of co-activation patterns and functional properties of each of the cytoarchitectonically defined areas. The results demonstrate that sACC is a brain region which
consists of four distinct areas with a matching structural and functional
segregation.

Material and methods

Continuous probabilistic maps and maximum probability maps

We examined the cytoarchitectonic properties of sACC in ten post
mortem human brains obtained through the body donor program
of the Department of Anatomy, University of Düsseldorf (Table 1).
Brains were fixed for 5 months in Bodian's fixative or in 4% formaldehyde, and scanned with a T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequence
(“MR-volume”; flip angle = 40°; repetition time TR = 40 ms; echo
time TE = 5 ms for each image; 128 sagittal sections; spatial resolution

into 6 to 7 thousand whole-brain sections (20 μm thick) in the coronal
(6 cases) or horizontal (4 cases) plane with a large-scale microtome.
Each 15th section (distance between sections: 300 μm) was mounted
on gelatine-coated slides, stained for cell bodies with a modified silver
cell-body staining (Merker, 1983; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008),
and digitized in a flatbed scanner (Epson Perfection V750 Pro;
1200 dpi, 20 μm per pixel).
Areas 25, s24, s32 and 33 had been previously identified by
cytoarchitectonical analysis and the borders were defined based on an
observer-independent mapping approach (Palomero-Gallagher et al.,
2008; Schleicher et al., 2005; Zilles et al., 2002). The extent of the different sACC areas was interactively traced in the high-resolution images of
the histological sections using in-house software. These traces were
used to calculate volumes of the individual sACC areas using Cavalieri's
principle, and for 3D-reconstruction of the mapped areas (Amunts et al.,
2005).
The histological volume of each of the examined brains was 3Dreconstructed by linear and non-linear registration to the MR volume
of each individual brain (Hömke, 2006). Thus, deformations and shrinkage inevitably caused by the histological techniques could be corrected.
For the 3D-reconstruction of histological volumes, we separated the
hemispheres by means of labeled masks, and were thus able to iteratively correct images of the left and right hemispheres using a sectionby-section elastic alignment of adjacent sections at high-resolution
(Mohlberg et al., 2012). The ensuing histological volumes were spatially
normalized to the corresponding hemispheres of the single-subject T1weighted MNI reference brain (Collins et al., 1994; Evans et al., 2012) in
anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al., 2005) using an affine and nonlinear elastic registration approach (Henn et al., 1997; Hömke, 2006).
This procedure enabled superimposition of all cytoarchitectonical
areas delineated in the ten individual post mortem brains in the common stereotaxic reference template. We then computed continuous
probabilistic maps of the different sACC areas in anatomical MNI
space. Thus, for each voxel in the reference brain, the probability that
an architectonical entity could be found at a certain position in stereotaxic space was characterized by values ranging between 0% and 100%.
Finally, maximum probability maps (MPM) were calculated by
assigning each voxel in the reference brain to the cytoarchitectonic
area with the highest probability in that voxel (Eickhoff et al., 2005,
2006b). When two areas shared the same probability in a particular
voxel, this voxel was assigned to the area with the higher average probabilities in directly adjacent voxels. A threshold of 40% was applied to
those voxels where the delineated sACC area abutted cortical regions
which have not yet been mapped using the observer independent
parcellation of the present analysis (i.e., BA12 at the ventral border of
area s32).
Thus, these maps quantitatively express the intersubject variability
of a cortical area in stereotaxic space. They can be downloaded at

Statistical analysis of histological volumes

The volumes of the individual ACC areas were analyzed with respect
to interhemispheric and gender differences using Monte-Carlo permutation tests. Prior to this analysis, all areal volumes were expressed as
a fraction of total brain volume for each brain in order to adjust for differences in total brain size, i.e. we searched for true gender differences
(Luders et al., 2014; Perlaki et al., 2014).
For the analysis of gender differences, we first computed the
difference in the mean volumes between the 5 male and 5 female


-----

histologically processed brains. Under the null-hypothesis of gender
exchangeability, we then randomly reassigned each brain to one of
the two groups (male/female), and re-computed the respective difference between the mean volumes of the ensuing randomly assembled
groups. This difference obtained under the null-hypothesis (that brain
assignment to a gender group is irrelevant) was recorded, and the
procedure repeated 10[6] times. The true gender difference was considered significant if it was larger than 95% of the values under the empirical null-distribution (p b 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons).
In contrast to this between-subject design to assess gender differences, the analysis of interhemispheric differences used a withinsubject design. In particular, we first computed the differences between
left and right areal volumes in each brain. The mean of these values represents the average interhemispheric difference in the ensuing pairedtest design. Under the null-hypothesis that there is no difference between the hemispheres and that side-labels may hence be freely exchangeable, we then randomly and independently across subjects
designated the two measurements as “left” or “right”. Again, the mean
differences between “left” and “right” areal volumes across subjects
were calculated, which provided a difference value for each area
under the null-hypothesis that the left and right values were not systematically different. This procedure was repeated 10[6] times and interhemispheric differences were considered significant if they were larger
than 95% of the values under the empirical null-distribution (p b 0.05;
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).

Connectivity and function of the sACC areas

Task-based functional connectivity of the defined cytoarchitectonic
areas was investigated using meta-analytic connectivity modeling
(MACM; Eickhoff et al., 2010; Jakobs et al., 2012), while functional associations were investigated using quantitative functional decoding
(Cieslik et al., 2013; Rottschy et al., 2013). As a first, common, step to
both analyses, the MPM representations of cytoarchitectonically defined areas 25, s24 and s32 were used to define volumes of interest
with which to perform a location query within the BrainMap database
[(www.brainmap.org; Fox and Lancaster, 2002). We only considered ex-](http://www.brainmap.org)
periments reporting stereotaxic coordinates from normal mapping
studies in healthy subjects using either fMRI or PET. Thus, no studies
reporting pharmacological interventions or group comparisons (e.g.
male vs. female or left-handed vs. right-handed participants) were included. All eligible BrainMap experiments were considered because a
pre-selection of taxonomic categories would constitute a fairly strong
a priori hypothesis about how brain networks are organized Inclusion
criteria yielded (at the time of analysis) approximately 12,000 functional neuroimaging experiments on which all further analyses were based.
The key idea behind MACM is to first identify all experiments in a database that activate a particular brain region (seed VOI), and then test
for convergence across (all) activation foci reported in these experiments (cf. Eickhoff and Grefkes, 2011; Laird et al., 2013). Obviously, as
experiments were selected by activation in the seed, highest convergence will be observed in the seed region. This local cluster encroaches
slightly onto directly adjacent areas and, at times, can extend over them
and merge with a cluster situated in the vicinity.
Significant convergence of the reported foci in other brain regions,
however, indicates consistent co-activation over experiments with the
seed region. Practically, convergence of co-activations was assessed
using the Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) approach. First, all
foci from the experiments reporting at least one activation within our
volumes of interest were treated as 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty resulting from the betweensubject and between-template variability of neuroimaging data
(Eickhoff et al., 2009; Turkeltaub et al., 2012). Modeling with the ALE algorithm reveals statistical convergence of reported activations across
different experiments and the results were interpreted under the


assumption that the observed clusters have a higher probability than
given only random convergence. To identify random and non-random
foci clusters, the obtained ALE values were compared with a nulldistribution reflecting a random spatial association between the considered experiments (Eickhoff et al., 2012). Results were thresholded at
voxel-level family wise error corrected p b 0.05. Pairwise conjunctions
over all areas were also computed to determine possible similarities in
the co-activation patterns of sACC areas.
To assess differential co-activation between areas, voxel-wise differences of the ALE scores from the individual MACM analyses were computed. The resulting difference maps were tested for significance using a
permutation test. The experiments contributing to either analysis were
pooled and randomly divided into two groups of the same size as the
contrasted experiments (Eickhoff and Grefkes, 2011). Resulting voxelwise ALE scores for these random groups were subtracted and recorded
to obtain an empirical null distribution of ALE score differences between
the two co-activation maps (10,000 permutations). Based on this distribution obtained under the null hypothesis of label exchangeability, the
map of true ALE differences was thresholded at a posterior probability of
p b 0.95 for a true difference between the two samples. The resulting
difference maps were masked with the main effect of the respective
cytoarchitectonic sACC area.
We furthermore functionally characterized the histologically defined regions based on the “behavioral domain” and “paradigm class”
meta-data from the retrieved experiments. That is, this analysis was
also based on filtering the BrainMap database for experiments activating the respective histological area, but in contrast to the MACM analysis, we now did not examine the co-activation profile, but rather probed
the functional descriptions of the experiments that activate a particular
region. Behavioral domains include the main categories cognition, action, perception, emotion, and interoception, as well as their related
sub-categories. Paradigm classes categorize the specific task employed
[(see http://brainmap.org/scribe for more information on the BrainMap](http://brainmap.org/scribe)
taxonomy). Individual functional profiles were characterized using forward and reverse inference (cf. Cieslik et al., 2013; Clos et al., 2013;
Kellermann et al., 2013). Forward inference is the probability of observing activity in a brain region given knowledge of the psychological process, whereas reverse inference is the probability of a psychological
process being present given knowledge of activation in a particular
brain region. In the forward inference approach, the functional profile
was determined by identifying taxonomic labels for which the probability of finding activation in the respective region/set of regions was significantly higher than the overall chance across the entire database of
finding activation in that particular region/set of regions. Significance
was established using a binomial test (p b 0.05, corrected for multiple
comparisons using false discovery rate). That is, we tested whether
the conditional probability of activation given a particular label

[P(Activation|Task)] was higher than the baseline probability of activating the region(s) in question per se [P(Activation)]. In the reverse inference approach, the functional profile was determined by identifying the
most likely behavioral domains and paradigm classes given activation in
a particular region/set of regions. This likelihood P(Task|Activation) can
be derived from P(Activation|Task) as well as P(Task) and P(Activation)
using Bayes rule. Significance (at p b 0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using FDR) was then assessed by means of a chi-squared test.
Finally, we also carried out a functional characterization of the coactivation map of each area.

Results

Cyto- and receptorarchitectonically defined borders and their relationship
to macroscopical landmarks

Area 25 was located mainly on the subcallosal gyrus, and its rostral
border was often found in the anterior parolfactory sulcus, which was
present in 16 out of 20 hemispheres (Fig. 1). However, area 25 extended

rostral to the anterior parolfactory sulcus in both hemispheres of case 5
and in the right hemisphere of cases 15 and 18. It encroached hereby
onto the cingulate gyrus in case 5 and the superior rostral gyrus in
cases 15 and 18. Area 25 never reached the orbitofrontal surface of the
brain.
Area s24 was restricted in its most rostral portion to the cingulate
gyrus, where its dorsal and ventral borders were located within the
callosal and cingulate sulci, respectively. Caudally, however, s24 also extended ventrally onto the superior rostral gyrus, and in six hemispheres
(right hemisphere of cases 5, 6 and 10, left hemisphere of cases 10, 15,


and 18) even encroached onto the inferior rostral gyrus. Area s24 was
delimited dorsally by area 33 and caudally by area 25. Ventrally area
s24 was delimited by orbitofrontal area 11 and sACC area s32 at its caudal and rostral portions, respectively.
Area s32 was located mainly on the superior rostral gyrus only at its
rostral portion. Its border with s24 was located close to the fundus of the
cingulate sulcus. However, the caudal portion of s32 extended ventrally
onto the inferior rostral gyrus. Area s32 was delimited ventrally by
orbito-frontal areas 11 (caudally) and 12 (rostrally), dorsocaudally by
area s24, and did not have a common border with area 25.


-----

Area 33 was found as a narrow strip of cortex buried in the callosal
sulcus. It commenced on the paraterminal gyrus, caudally abutting
area 25, formed an arc around the genu of the corpus callosum, and
ended approximately over the middle of the callosal body.

Probabilistic maps and variability

Areas 25, s24, s32 and 33 (Fig. 2) were registered to the MNI reference brain in order to compute continuous probability maps and quantify intersubject variability of their size and location. In general, a high
intersubject variability was found. s24 was the least variable area,
since it presented the largest number of voxels with the highest overlap


of all ten brains. Conversely, area 33 was the area with the highest
intersubject variability.
Since the continuous probability maps of different adjoining areas
overlap, MPMs were computed. They present a contiguous, nonoverlapping parcellation of the subgenual anterior cingulate cortex
which reflects, for each voxel, the most likely area at that position in a
sample of ten human post mortem brains (Fig. 3).

Volumetric analysis

Area s24 was the largest and 25 the smallest of the sACC areas
(Table 2). Their volumes can vary by 1.7 (25), 1.7 (33), 2.9 (s32), and

in female brains. However, there were no interhemispheric differences

Task-dependent functional connectivity

We quantitatively mapped task-based co-activations of areas 25,
s24, s32 and 33 co-activations using the BrainMap database. We found
36 experiments in the BrainMap database which described activation
foci in area 25. A total of 153, 202, and 144 experiments in the BrainMap
database reported activations within areas s24, s32 and 33, respectively.
Using meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM), we found distinct
patterns of co-activation clusters for each of the sACC areas.
Area 25 (Fig. 4, Table 3) was associated with four co-activation clusters spread throughout the brain. Maxima within these clusters were located in areas of the inferior left parietal lobe (area 1), the right inferior
occipital gyrus (area hOc2 or BA18; Table 3) and the right superior cingulate gyrus rostral to the genu of the corpus callosum (pACC; Table 3).
The pACC region encompasses areas p24 and p32. Additionally, we
found a co-activation cluster in the cerebellum (lobule IX).
Area s24 (Fig. 4, Table 3) was associated with six co-activation clusters. Maxima within these clusters were located in the inferior parietal
lobe (area PGp; Table 3) and the posterior cingulate cortex caudal to
the splenium of the corpus callosum (vPCC) of the left hemisphere.
The region vPCC encompasses areas 23d, d23 and 31 (Table 3). Further
co-activation foci were found bilaterally in the laterobasal group of the
amygdala and in the right anterior portion of the thalamus connected

seed region also contained maxima located within the left frontopolar
area Fp2 (Table 3) and the pACC.
Area s32 (Fig. 4, Table 3) also co-activated with both cortical and
subcortical structures. Three clusters were located within the posterior
cingulate cortex: one on the left cingulate gyrus just above the splenium
of the corpus callosum (dPCC), and two in vPCC. Although the latter coactivation was bilateral, the cluster in the left vPCC (301 voxels) was
considerably larger than that in the right one (9 voxels). Additionally,
area s32 co-activated with inferior parietal area PGp (Table 3) and the
hippocampal Cornu Ammonis (CA) region of the left hemisphere as
well as with a cluster located on the ventral bank of the superior frontal
sulcus. Subcortically, the left globus pallidus and nucleus accumbens as
well as the right laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala co-activated with


area s32. Furthermore, the cluster surrounding the seed region also
contained a maximum located within the right frontopolar area Fp2
(Table 3).
Area 33 (Fig. 4, Table 3) co-activated with a cluster located on the
right cingulate gyrus just above the splenium of the corpus callosum.
Since this cluster could not be unequivocally assigned to area 23 of the
PCC or areas 29 or 30 of the retrosplenial cortex (RSC; Table 3), it was
denominated dPCC/RSC. Additionally, area 33 co-activated with clusters
located on the medial surface of the right superior frontal gyrus, in the
left opercular area OP 1 (Table 3), and in the left rolandic operculum.
Furthermore, area 33 co-activated bilaterally with clusters located in
the anterior insular cortex and in the anterior portion of the thalamus
connected with the prefrontal cortex (Table 3).

The conjunction analyses revealed a relative small overlap in the coactivation patterns of sACC areas, which only involved areas s24, s32
and 33, but excluded area 25 (Fig. 5, Table 4). Areas s24 and s32 had
four common co-activation clusters: in area PGp and the vPCC region
of the left hemisphere, as well as in the right amygdala and the left nucleus accumbens. Areas s32 and 33 shared one common co-activation
cluster, which was also located in the left nucleus accumbens.
The contrast analyses (Table 5) revealed that s24 was more strongly
associated with the left nucleus accumbens than s32. It showed a stronger co-activation with the left vPCC and CA regions and with the left

and CA regions and with the left area PGp than was area 25. Additionally, s32 was stronger co-activated with area PGp and the superior frontal
sulcus of the left hemisphere as well as with the laterobasal nucleus of
the amygdala and vPCC of the right hemisphere than was area 33.
Area 33 was more strongly associated with the left rolandic operculum,
left anterior insula, right dPCC/RSC, and bilateral thalamus than were
s24 or s32. Additionally, area 33 also showed a stronger co-activation
with OP 1 than did s32. Finally, 33 was more strongly co-activated


with the left amygdala, anterior insula and area OP 1 as well as with
the right dPCC/RSC than was area 25.

Functional characterization of sACC areas

We performed a functional decoding analysis based on the BrainMap
meta-data to outline the functional profiles of areas 25, s24, s32 and 33
and determine the functional domains and paradigm classes with which
they were significantly associated (Fig. 6). The additional functional
characterization of each area's co-activation network revealed very similar and, hence, unspecific results for all areas. This was particularly obvious for the reverse inference (Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore, we
constrain the functional profiling to the area-specific analysis.
Notably, there were significant effects for area 25 only in the reverse
inference approach, where it belonged to the emotion behavioral domain and the reward paradigm class (Fig. 6). Therefore, we did not further characterize functions assigned to this area because results were
considered robust only in the case of congruent forward and inverse inferences (see Material and methods).
Area s24 (Fig. 6) was significantly associated with emotion, i.e. the
mental faculty of experiencing an affective state of consciousness. Additionally, it was specifically found to be activated by emotions of sorrow
or mourning characterized by unhappiness or grief. Area s24 was also
significantly activated by the face monitor/discrimination task and by
cognitive processes, in particular with the reward and episodic recall
tasks, and associated with the sense of tasting and with interoception,
i.e. the processing of stimuli originating inside of the body.
Area s32 (Fig. 6) was also found to be significantly associated with
emotion and cognition, in particular with memory processes. However,
in contrast to area s24, area s32 was linked to the processing of fear
rather than to that of sadness. Area s32 was also activated by reward
tasks, which can be grouped under both the cognition and the emotion
behavioral domains, as well as with music comprehension/production
tasks, which are coupled with the cognitive behavioral domain.
Area 33 (Fig. 6) was assigned to the interoception and pain perception domains, in particular monitoring and discrimination of painful
thermal or electrical stimulation.

Discussion

The present study provides an analysis of the organization of the
human subgenual anterior cingulate cortex by determining the functional
domains and connectivity of the cytoarchitectonically defined sACC areas
25, s24, s32, and 33 (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008). To this end we generated continuous and maximum probability maps, the latter of which
were used as seed volumes for subsequent database-driven analysis of
task-dependent functional connectivity and functional decoding. Hereby,
functions of cytoarchitectonic areas and their interactions with other
brain regions could be inferred. Areas 25, s24, s32 and 33 differed in
their functional connectivity profiles and behavioral domains. s24 and
s32 co-activated with different components of the affective (George
et al., 1995) and executive control (Seeley et al., 2007) networks. Additionally, s32 co-activated with elements of the emotional–arousal
(George et al., 1995; Lévesque et al., 2003) and default mode networks.
Area 33 co-activated with components of the sensorimotor (Hänggi
et al., 2010) and pain (Apkarian and Shi, 1994; Frot and Mauguiere,
2003; Treede et al., 2000) networks, whereas 25 did so with areas of the
autonomic afferent processing network (Labus et al., 2008). Areas s24
and s32 shared a common functional profile involving the cognition and
emotion behavioral domains. Areas s24 and s32 were both associated
with emotion, but are involved in the processing of sadness and fear, respectively. Areas s24 and 33 are both activated during interoception.
s24 was involved in the perception of taste, and area 33 in that of pain.
Notably, no co-activation clusters could be determined for the 36 experiments activating area 25, nor could it be associated with a specific
domain in both forward and reverse inference procedures, indicating

that either the functional categories which activate area 25 are not consistently represented in psychological domains as covered by the
BrainMap database (Fox and Lancaster, 2002).

sACC and volumetric analyses

None of the sACC areas showed interhemispheric differences. Likewise, Gittins and Harrison (2004) did not find differences in neuronal
densities between left and right human area 24. Further support
comes from studies assessing gray matter volume by means of voxelbased morphometry (VBM; Almeida et al., 2009; Kong et al., 2013;
Liao et al., 2014) or by definition of volumes of interest based on
macroscopical landmarks (Coryell et al., 2005; Fornito et al., 2009; Koo
et al., 2008; Zetzsche et al., 2007). They revealed no interhemispheric
differences within the sACC of healthy volunteers. Additionally, a
meta-analysis examining the effect of emotional valence on regional
brain activations found no lateralization of emotional function in the
sACC of healthy male or female subjects (Wager et al., 2003).
Functional imaging studies have revealed gender-specific differences in the sACC at rest (Filippi et al., 2013; Gur et al., 1995) and in response to tasks probing for different aspects of affect and emotion
processing (Butler et al., 2005; Grossman and Wood, 1993; Kohn et al.,
2011; Lebron-Milad and Milad, 2012). The present results suggest the
contribution of specific cytoarchitectonically identified areas, namely
s24 and s32, to these regional gender differences, and may shed light
on the neurobiologic substrates of behavioral gender differences in
healthy volunteers. Since male brains are larger than female brains, it
is important to control the gender difference for the effect of absolute
brain size (Luders et al., 2014; Perlaki et al., 2014). In the present
study, s32 and s24 were larger in the brains of males than in those of females even after correction for absolute brain size. A recent VBM study
found smaller sACC/orbitofrontal volumes in women than in men (Li


et al., 2014), although other studies assessing gray matter volume by
means of VBM (Almeida et al., 2009; Kong et al., 2013; Liao et al.,
2014) or by definition of volumes of interest based on macroscopical
landmarks (Coryell et al., 2005; Fornito et al., 2009; Koo et al., 2008;
Zetzsche et al., 2007) did not describe gender differences within the
sACC of healthy volunteers.
The controversial results reported in the literature may be caused by
different definitions of the structural entities. In many areas of the cerebral cortex, such entities cannot be reliably defined, even in high resolution MR images, because, as shown in the present study, the borders of
cytoarchitectonically defined sACC areas are not consistently associated
with macroscopical landmarks. E.g., although cytoarchitectonically defined area 33 is buried in the callosal sulcus, its lateral border cannot
be defined by a landmark. The parolfactory sulcus was the anterior
border of area 25 in many cases, but cannot be considered a reliable
landmark in all cases, since it was absent in 20% of our examined hemispheres (n = 20). Furthermore, area 25 extended rostral to this landmark in 25% of the cases in which the sulcus was present. The
situation for s24 was even more complicated: the rostral border of this
area could not be aligned to any landmark, the caudal border varied depending on the extent of area 25 or the presence of the anterior
parolfactory sulcus, and its ventral border was the cingulate sulcus,
but in 20% of the hemispheres this sulcus did not extend sufficiently in
the ventro-caudal direction to serve as a reliable border. Since the dorsal
and caudal borders of s32 were found in the cingulate sulcus, where it
adjoined s24, this landmark provided the same difficulties as discussed
for s24, i.e., the cingulate sulcus was not always present at this position.
A comparable problem applied to the ventral border of s32, since the superior rostral sulcus did not always extend far enough caudally to provide a reliable ventral macroscopical landmark. The rostral border of
s32 could not be aligned to any macroscopical landmark either. It clearly
extended rostral to the most frequently used landmark, i.e., the coronal


-----

plane defined through the most rostral tip of the genu corporis callosi.
Thus, no macroscopical landmark highlighted the border between
sACC and pACC. The variable relationship between macroscopical
landmarks and cytoarchitectonically defined borders is shown in Fig. 1.
Therefore, we can conclude, probabilistic cytoarchitectonic brain maps
are necessary for a reliable and precise anatomical localization of functional imaging data or of volumetric MRI-based studies. Although it is
true that in some cases sulci are good predictors of Brodmann's areas
(Fischl et al., 2008), probabilistic maps are necessary to quantify variability in the position, size and extent of cytoarchitectonic areas, and enable
statistical analysis of topographical relationships between the localization of cytoarchitectonical borders and macroanatomical landmarks
(Amunts et al., 2007; Weiner et al., 2014; Zilles et al., 2002).
Finally, existing volumetric studies have mostly underestimated the
volume of human sACC, since its rostral boundary is often set at the coronal plane defined by the rostral extreme of the genu of the corpus
callosum (Asami et al., 2008; Frodl et al., 2008; Malykhin et al., 2012;
Yucel et al., 2009). This also holds true for studies in non-human primates (Blatchley and Hopkins, 2010). These studies underestimate the
volume of sACC, i.e. the sum of the volumes of cytoarchitectonically defined areas 25, s24 and s32, by 32%. When considering each area individually, they underestimate the volume of areas s24 and s32 by 6%
and 60%, respectively, though not that of area 25.

Functional connectivity and functional domains of sACC areas

Meta-analytic co-activation analyses place the functional aspects of
a single area into the context of a neural network. This may be particularly fruitful to infer brain–behavior relationships according to the functional integration perspective on brain function (Fox and Friston, 2012).
Hence, we discuss the functional organization of the sACC and the putative roles of areas 25, s24, s32 and 33 based on commonalities as well as
on differences between co-activation networks. Areas s24 and s32 share
the greatest degree of overlap in their co-activation networks, as revealed by the conjunction analysis, while contrasts highlight distinct
connectivity patterns for areas 25 and 33, and less so for s24 and s32. Although functional connectivity does not imply a direct anatomical connection between the respective brain regions (Eickhoff and Grefkes,
2011), co-activations of s24 and s32 with the amygdala may be based
on the anatomical connectivity, as identified in fiber tracking studies
in the human brain based on diffusion weighted imaging (JohansenBerg et al., 2008), or in tracer studies in non-human primates
(Freedman et al., 2000). Likewise, co-activations of s24 and s32 with different parts of the PCC may be explained by the intracingulate connections described for the monkey (Vogt and Pandya, 1987).
Area 25, the main hub of the cortical autonomic network (Gianaros
et al., 2005; Kimmerly et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2007), was found to coactivate with the cerebellum and pACC regions, which have also been described as belonging to the cortical autonomic (Gianaros et al., 2005;
Kimmerly et al., 2005; Wong et al., 2007). Area 25 has been associated
with the more automated bottom-up aspects of emotional processing
and, therefore, functional neuroimaging using contrasts between different experimental conditions in the MR scanner rarely finds functional
specific activation of area 25. Indeed, only 36 of the ~12,000 experiments
currently stored in the BrainMap database result in an activation of this
area. Therefore, it is not surprising that no behavioral domain or paradigm
class could be significantly associated with area 25 in the present study.
Area 33 co-activated with areas of the previously defined sensorimotor network (Hänggi et al., 2010), including cytoarchitectonically defined
area OP 1 (Eickhoff et al., 2006c), which has been involved in the perception of painful stimuli (Eickhoff et al., 2006a; Farrell et al., 2005; Frot and
Mauguiere, 2003). Area 33 also co-activated with the anterior insula,
which is considered to be part of both medial and lateral pain systems
due to its output into the amygdala and anterior cingulate cortex, and
its input from lateral thalamic nuclei (Apkarian and Shi, 1994; Frot and
Mauguiere, 2003; Treede et al., 2000). The specificity of these co

activations was confirmed by the conjunction and contrasts analyses.
Therefore, and given that ACC is also thought to mediate the affectivemotivational component in pain perception, on which emotional
reflexes following the painful sensation depend (Farrell et al., 2005;
Price, 2000; Vogt, 2005), it is not surprising to find that area 33, a
cytoarchitectonical entity within the ACC, is significantly associated
with the processing of pain, as revealed by the functional decoding analysis. However, at this point it is also important to emphasize, that area 33
is not restricted to sACC, but that it extends rostrally and dorsally into
pACC and the midcingulate cortex. Therefore, the assignment of pain as
a function of area 33 remains to be supported by further observations.
The functional connectivity patterns of areas s24 and s32 presented
the greatest degree of overlap. The conjunction analysis revealed that
they both co-activated with cytoarchitectonically identified area PGp
(Caspers et al., 2006), the vPCC, and the nucleus accumbens of the left
hemisphere, as well as with the laterobasal nucleus of the right amygdala. Additionally, both areas co-activated with cytoarchitectonically
defined medial frontopolar area Fp2 (Bludau et al., 2014), although
s24 did so in the right hemisphere and s32 in the left one. Coactivation of areas s24 and s32 with area Fp2 and the laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala is in accordance with the fact that the sACC, medial
frontopolar cortex and amygdala have been described as being components of the affective network, which attaches an emotional significance
to external stimuli (George et al., 1995). Co-activation of s24 and s32
with Fp2 also provides further evidence for the involvement of the mesial part of the human frontal pole in emotional control and social cognition (Bludau et al., 2014; Dreher et al., 2008). We found areas s24
and s32 to be associated with the processing of emotion. Indeed, numerous studies have linked the ACC with the processing of emotions such as
happiness, sadness and fear. Specifically, sACC activity plays a crucial
role in regulating the impact of aversive stimuli and is associated with
sadness, whereas happiness-related activations have been assigned to
pACC (George et al., 1995; Karama et al., 2011; Liotti et al., 2000;
Smith et al., 2011; Vogt, 2005). In accordance with these reports, our
functional decoding analysis revealed the existence of an association
of sACC areas with tasks involving the processing of sadness, and not
with that of happiness. sACC is also associated with fear conditioning
and its inhibition during extinction of learned fear (Etkin et al., 2011;
Linnman et al., 2012; Mechias et al., 2010), and may represent the
domain-general controller of perceived fear and aversiveness thought
to modulate negative affective responses in phylogenetically older
structures of the emotion processing system (Diekhof et al., 2011;
Etkin et al., 2011; Linares et al., 2012).
However, it is important to note that areas s24 and s32 also showed
significant differences in co-activations, with area s24 in contrast to s32
more connected to the basal ganglia and s32 more related to the vPCC.
The basal ganglia, and in particular the nucleus accumbens, are more involved in bottom-up emotional processing, whereas the vPCC is associated in top-down processing, as the internal representation and
evaluation of emotion. This functional difference between the preferential co-activation of s24 and s32 is paralleled by each area's respective
functional characterization. We found that s24 was the only sACC area
specifically involved in the processing of sadness, and s32 was the specific site within sACC to be activated during the processing of fear. The
present study shows that the definition of areas s24 and s32 within
the region of Brodmann's areas 24 and 32, respectively, and within
sACC (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008) is not a simple “anatomical”
refinement. Rather, the present results demonstrate for the first time
the existence of a structural/functional entity different from the rest of
BA24 and sACC, since s24 differs by its cyto- and receptorarchitecture
from the other areas of BA24 and of sACC (Palomero-Gallagher et al.,
2008), and is specifically involved in the processing of sadness. Likewise,
s32 is also a distinct structural and functional entity which must be
clearly separated as a cortical area from the rest of BA32 and sACC.
The whole region of the anterior cingulate cortex has been described
as the site involved in the integration of information concerning the

consonance of taste and olfactory components in order to assess pleasantness during food intake, i.e. reward-related information, whereas
cortical activity in the anterior insula is associated with the processing
of physical properties such as intensity of odor or taste (McCabe and
Rolls, 2007; Rolls, 2009; Small, 2012). The amygdala also plays a pivotal
role in the encoding of aversive and appetitive stimuli, as well as in the
amygdala–cingulate interactions occurring during potential threat assessment (Fernando et al., 2013; Fiddick, 2011; Fossati, 2012; Shin and
Liberzon, 2010; Toyoda et al., 2011). Although we found both s24 and
s32 to be co-activated with the laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala,
only area s24 was associated with the perception of gustation, i.e., it
was the only cyto- and receptorarchitectonical distinct cortical area
within sACC(Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2008), which is activated during
the emotional evaluation of taste.
Furthermore, sACC has been shown to play a modulatory role in the
suppressed processing of emotional stimuli under cognitive demand
(Kellermann et al., 2013), and we found an association of areas s24 and
s32 with the cognition domain of the BrainMap database (Fox and
Lancaster, 2002), i.e. with the integration of awareness, perception, reasoning, and judgment. This is in accordance with the hypothesis that
sACC forms part of a network subserving the cognitive control of emotion (Cromheeke and Mueller, 2014). sACC is activated when a cognitive
control task is carried out in an emotional context, or the emotional stimuli are relevant to the cognitive task being carried out (Cromheeke and
Mueller, 2014). Both areas are activated by tasks such as the reward
task, which involve a cognition–emotion interaction within a cognitive
control setting, which is mirrored in their shared co-activation network
comprising the basal ganglia, amygdala, vPCC and area PGp. However,
only area s32 was associated with the cognition memory subdomain,
i.e. with the mental faculty of retaining and reviving facts, events, or impressions, or of recalling or recognizing previous experiences.
In conclusion, the sACC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous brain region. We have shown that functions which have
previously been attributed to the complete sACC should in fact be attributed to cytoarchitectonically distinct areas within this region: area s24
is activated during the processing of sadness and the emotional evaluation of taste, whereas areas s32 and 33 are associated with fear extinction and pain perception, respectively. Additionally, areas s24, s32 and
33 differ in their functional connectivity profiles, and co-activate with
a widespread, minimally overlapping network of cortical and subcortical structures which have been attributed to affective, executive control,
or sensorimotor networks.
