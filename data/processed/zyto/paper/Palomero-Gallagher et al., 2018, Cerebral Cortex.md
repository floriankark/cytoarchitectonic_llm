### Abstract

##### The human pregenual anterior cingulate cortex (pACC) encompasses 7 distinct cyto- and receptorarchitectonic areas. We lack a detailed understanding of the functions in which they are involved, and stereotaxic maps are not available. We present an integrated structural/functional map of pACC based on probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping and meta- analytic connectivity modeling and quantitative functional decoding. Due to the restricted spatial resolution of functional imaging data relative to the microstructural parcellation, areas p24a of the callosal sulcus and p24b on the surface of the cingulate gyrus were merged into a “gyral component” (p24ab) of area p24, and areas pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd, located within the cingulate sulcus were merged into a “sulcal component” (p24c) for meta-analytic analysis. Area p24ab was specifically associated with interoception, p24c with the inhibition of action, and p32, which was also activated by emotion induction tasks pertaining negatively valenced stimuli, with the ability to experience empathy. Thus, area p32 could be classified as cingulate association cortex playing a crucial role in the cognitive regulation of emotion. By this spectrum of functions, pACC is a structurally and functionally heterogeneous region, clearly differing from other parts of the anterior and middle cingulate cortex.

 Key words: anterior cingulate cortex, cytoarchitecture, functional decoding, functional meta-analysis, human brain, probability maps


### Introduction

The anterior cingulate cortex (ACC) occupies the rostral portion
of Brodmann’s (1909) Subregio praecingularis (which encompasses
his areas 24, 25, 32, and 33), and is activated by diverse tasks
ranging from emotion processing and regulation to attention and


cognitive control (Bush et al. 2000; Allman et al. 2001; Paus 2001;
Phan et al. 2002; Fellows and Farah 2005). The diversity of functional domains assigned to the ACC led to its segregation into
pregenual (pACC) and subgenual (sACC) parts. Whereas sACC
has been associated with the processing of negatively valenced

stimuli and emotions (George et al. 1995; Phan et al. 2002; Kross
et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2011; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2015),
pACC is thought to subserve the processing of positively
valenced stimuli (Vogt et al. 2003). It is also activated by attention
and conflict-monitoring tasks (Allman et al. 2001; Fellows and
Farah 2005). This functional heterogeneity of the ACC is associated with regional variations in the functional connectivity profiles of the pregenual and subgenual portions of the cingulate
gyrus, as repeatedly demonstrated by meta-analytic connectivity
modeling studies (Beckmann et al. 2009; Torta and Cauda 2011;
Torta et al. 2013).
The functionally driven subdivision of the ACC region is not
reflected in the cytoarchitectonic maps of Brodmann (1909; Fig.
1A), Öngür et al. (2003), Petrides et al. (2012), or Vogt et al. (1995),
where the ACC consists of semicircular fields which surround
the corpus callosum, but without a separation into dorsal and
ventral parts. However, a recent cytoarchitectonic study using
quantitative analysis of cell-body distributions has demonstrated a higher structural differentiation of the ACC, which is
further supported by a concomitant analysis of the regional and
laminar distribution patterns of 15 different transmitter receptors (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008; Fig. 1B). This multimodal
approach resulted in the definition of 12 areas within ACC, with
2 streams of structural differentiation: 1) 7 areas could be identified based on differences in the degree of laminar differentiation
when moving from the corpus callosum towards the convexity
of the hemisphere, 2) differences in the size and packing density
layer III and layer V neurons within areas 24a, 24b, and 32, as
well as the presence of area 25 ventral to the corpus callosum,
enabled the definition of pregenual (encompassing areas p24a,
p24b, pv24c, pd24cv, pd24cd, p32) and subgenual (encompassing
areas s24a, s24b, pv24cd s32, 25) regions within the ACC
(Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008).
Areas of the sACC were recently brought into stereotaxic
space, and the resulting volumes were used for a cytoarchitectonically informed quantitative meta-analysis which confirmed
the significant association of sACC with the processing of negative emotions (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2015). More specifically, distinct architectonic areas within sACC are associated
with different kinds of negatively valenced emotional stimuli:
s24 is activated during the processing of sadness, whereas s32


is activated during the processing of fear (Palomero-Gallagher
et al. 2015). Furthermore, the probabilistic maps of sACC areas
highlight the lack of a correspondence between macroscopic
landmarks and the borders of all areas except for those of area
33, which was always buried in the callosal sulcus.
Comparable information, however, is not currently available
for pACC areas. Therefore, the current study aims to present an
integrated structural/functional map of pACC based on cytoarchitectonic mapping resulting in probabilistic, stereotaxic maps in
combination with a meta-analysis of functional imaging data.
The results of the present study demonstrate a remarkable
involvement of this brain region in the processing of negatively
valenced stimuli, though not in that of happiness. In addition to
its role in emotion induction, pACC contributes considerably to
cognitive functions such as social cognition, including theory of
mind tasks, and conflict-monitoring.

### Material and Methods

##### Continuous Probabilistic Maps and Maximum Probability Maps

We examined the cytoarchiteture of pACC areas in 10 postmortem fixed human brains (Table 1) scanned with a T1-weighted
magnetic resonance sequence (“MR volume”; flip angle = 40°;
repetition time TR = 40 ms; echo time TE = 5 ms for each image;
128 sagittal sections; spatial resolution 1 × 1 × 1.17 mm; 8 bit
gray value resolution) before histological processing. Brains
were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned (20 μm thick
sections) in the coronal (6 cases) or horizontal (4 cases) plane
with a large-scale microtome. Each 15th section was mounted
on gelatine-coated slides, stained for cell bodies with a modified silver cell-body staining (Merker 1983; Palomero-Gallagher
et al. 2008), and digitized in a flatbed scanner (Epson Perfection
V750 Pro; 1200 dpi, 20 μm per pixel).
Areas p24a, p24b, pv24c, pd24cv, pd24cd, and p32 had been
previously identified by an observer-independent cytoarchitectonic mapping approach (Fig. 1B), and their existence was confirmed by an additional multi-receptor analysis (Zilles et al.
2002; Schleicher et al. 2005; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008).
However, in our previous study (Palomero-Gallagher et al.

rostral portion of Brodmann’s Subregio praecingularis (which encompasses his areas 24, 25, 32, and 33).

2008), we only described the cyto- and receptorarchitectonic
features characterizing each of the identified areas, but provided no information concerning the intersubject variability in
their size and location, or of the relationship between borders
between areas and macroscopical landmarks. These aspects,
together with a characterization of the functional and connectivity profiles of pACC areas are the subject of the present
study.
In the present study, we merged specific cyto- and receptorarchitectonically identified areas for computation of probabilistic maps. This decision was driven by 3 main reasons: 1) The
restricted spatial resolution of functional imaging data relative
to the microstructural parcellation and the high degree of
structural segregation found within the pACC, 2) the necessity
to integrate different spatial and temporal scales and data
modalities into a common reference system to create interoperable multimodal human brain models (Amunts et al. 2014),
and 3) the differential connectivity patterns of the gyral and
sulcal portions of the cingulate cortex (Vogt and Pandya 1987;
Morecraft et al. 2012). Consequently, areas p24a of the callosal
sulcus and p24b on the surface of the cingulate gyrus were
merged into a “gyral component” (p24ab) of area p24. Areas
pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd located within the cingulate sulcus
were merged into a “sulcal component” (p24c) of area p24.
Thus, although the extent of all architectonically identified
pACC areas was interactively traced in the high-resolution
images of the histological sections using in-house software
(SectionTracer), traces were used for the 3D-reconstruction of
only of merged areas p24ab and p24c, as well as of p32. The
SectionTracer software (programmed in Java) produces asci
files with the coordinates of nodes in the traces of each area
relative to the top left corner of the high-resolution image of
the histological section containing the area in question, and
which are used for the subsequent 3D-reconstruction steps in
the pipeline.
The histological volume of each brain was 3D-reconstructed
by linear and non-linear registrations to its MR volume (Hömke
2006) to enable correction of deformations and shrinkage inevitably caused by histological techniques. Prior to this step,
images of the entire brains were separated by means of labeled
masks into left and right hemispheres, and those images of
the separated hemispheres were iteratively corrected using a
section-by-section elastic alignment of adjacent sections at
high-resolution (Mohlberg et al. 2012). Finally, the ensuing histological volumes were spatially normalized to the corresponding
hemispheres of the single-subject T1-weighted MNI reference


brain (Evans et al. 2012) in anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al.
2005) with an affine and non-linear elastic registration approach
(Henn et al. 1997; Hömke 2006). Cytoarchitectonic areas delineated in the 10 individual postmortem brains could thus be registered to the stereotaxic reference template brain. Having all
brains and delineations in the same reference space enabled
computation of continuous probabilistic maps for each pACC
area in anatomical MNI space. The probabilistic map of a given
area encodes for each voxel of the reference brain how many
individual brains showed the respective cytoarchitectonic area
in that voxel. Thus, continuous probability maps quantitatively
describe the intersubject variability of a cortical area in stereotaxic space. Maximum probability maps (MPMs) were then calculated by assigning each voxel of the reference brain to the
cytoarchitectonic area with the highest probability in that voxel
(Eickhoff et al. 2005, 2006). If 2 areas shared the same probability
in a particular voxel, this voxel was assigned to the area with
the higher average probabilities in directly adjacent voxels
(Eickhoff et al. 2005, 2006). A threshold of 40% was applied to
those voxels where the delineated pACC area abutted cortical
regions which have not yet been mapped using the observerindependent cytoarchitectonic approach (i.e., BA8 or BA9 at the
dorsal border of area p32).
These probabilistic maps quantitatively express the intersubject variability of a cortical area in stereotaxic space. They
can be viewed as surface representations through the JuBrain

##### Volumetry

The traces of p24ab, p24c, and p32 on the digital images of the
histological sections were used to calculate the volumes (V, in
mm[3]) of each area using Cavalieri’s principle (Amunts et al.
2005) according to:

##### V = s ⋅Δ ⋅Δ ⋅x y F ⋅ΣNi

where the distance (s) between 2 measured sections was 1.2 mm,
pixel size (Δx and Δy) was 0.02116 × 0.02116 mm, F was the individual shrinkage factor of each brain caused by the histological
processing, and Ni the number of pixels of the cortical area in
section i. The individual shrinkage factor was calculated for each


-----

brain as the ratio between the fresh volume of the brain and its
volume after histological processing (Amunts et al. 2005).
Volumes of pACC areas were further analyzed with respect
to interhemispheric and gender differences, as well as for the
interaction between gender and hemisphere using MonteCarlo permutation tests (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2015), and
P-values were Bonferroni corrected for multiple testing. In order
to compensate the trend of male brains to larger volumes compared to female brains (Luders et al. 2014; Perlaki et al. 2014), all
areal volumes were expressed as a fraction of total brain volume for each brain prior to statistical analysis. Gender differences were analyzed by first computing difference in the mean
volumes between the 5 male and 5 female brains, then randomly reassigning each brain to one of the 2 groups (male/
female), and re-computing the respective difference between
the mean volumes of the ensuing randomly assembled groups
was calculated. This difference obtained under the nullhypothesis of label exchangeability (i.e., that brain assignment
to a gender group is irrelevant) was recorded, and the procedure repeated 10[6] times. The true gender difference was considered significant if it was larger than 95% of the values under
the empirical null-distribution (P < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected
for multiple comparisons). Interhemispheric differences were
analyzed by means of a within-subject design. We first determined the average interhemispheric difference for the ensuing
paired-test design by computing the differences between left
and right areal volumes in each brain. We then randomly and
independently across subjects designated the 2 measurements
as “left” or “right”, and the mean differences between “left” and
“right” areal volumes across subjects were calculated, providing
a difference value for each area under the null-hypothesis that
left and right values were not systematically different. This
procedure was repeated 10[6] times and interhemispheric differences were considered significant if they were larger than 95%
of the values under the empirical null-distribution (P < 0.05;
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).

##### Connectivity and Function of the sACC Areas

We examined task-based functional connectivity and functional associations of cytoarchitectonically defined areas p24ab,
p24c, and p32 using meta-analytic connectivity modeling
(MACM; Eickhoff et al. 2010; Langner et al. 2014) and quantitative functional decoding (Cieslik et al. 2013; Rottschy et al.
[2013), respectively, based on the BrainMap database (www.](http://www.brainmap.org)
[brainmap.org; Fox and Lancaster 2002; Fox et al. 2014). The](http://www.brainmap.org)
MPM representation of each area was used to define the
volumes of interest. The BrainMap database contained over
15 000 neuroimaging experiments at the time of analysis, and
we considered all stereotaxic coordinates from mapping studies without interventions or group comparisons (amounting to
approximately 7500 studies) in healthy subjects using either
fMRI or PET, because a preselection of taxonomic categories
would result in a fairly strong a priori hypothesis about how
brain networks are organized.
The MACM analysis determines the convergence of foci
reported in different experiments that also activate the delineated regions, and these co-activation foci were modeled as
probability distributions based on the spatial uncertainty due
to the between-subject and between-template variability of
neuroimaging data. Co-activation patterns were assessed using
the activation likelihood estimation (ALE) non-parametric statistical approach (Eickhoff et al. 2012). To identify non-random
clusters of convergence over studies, the obtained ALE values


were compared with a null-distribution reflecting a random
spatial association between the considered experiments. The
analysis was thresholded at a cluster-level FWE corrected P <
0.05 (cluster-forming threshold at voxel-level P < 0.001), which
provides optimal balance between sensitivity and specificity as
shown in a large-scale simulation (Eickhoff, Nichols et al. 2016).
Pairwise conjunctions over all areas were also computed to
determine possible similarities in the co-activation patterns of
pACC areas. Additionally, voxel-wise differences of the ALE
scores from the individual MACM analyses were computed to
assess differential co-activation between areas, and thresholded at a posterior probability of P < 0.95 for a true difference using permutation testing (n = 5000; Eickhoff et al. 2018).
The resulting difference maps were masked with the main
effect of the respective cytoarchitectonic pACC area. Only clusters including at least 50 voxels are reported.
Functional characterization of pACC areas was based on filtering the BrainMap database for experiments activating the
respective MPMs followed by forward and reverse inference
analyses (cf. Cieslik et al. 2013; Rottschy et al. 2013) of the functional descriptions (i.e., the meta-data “Behavioural Domains”
and “Paradigm Classes”) of the experiments that activate a particular area. The Behavioural Domains in BrainMap classify
mental operations isolated by the experiments into 6 main categories (action, cognition, emotion, interoception, perception,
and pharmacology), whereas the Paradigm Classes represent
the specific experimental task used in the respective experiment (Fox, Laird et al. 2005). In the forward inference, the functional profile was determined by identifying those taxonomic
labels for which the probability of finding activation in the
region of interest was significantly higher than the overall
chance across the entire database of finding activation in that
particular region. We identified significant associations by
means of a binomial test (P < 0.05, corrected for multiple
comparisons using false discovery rate) to determine whether
the conditional probability of activation for a specific label

[P(Activation|Task)] was higher than the baseline probability of
activating the region(s) in question per se [P(Activation)]. In the
reverse inference [P(Task|Activation)], the functional profile
was determined by identifying the most probable behavioral
domains and Paradigm Classes given activation in a specific
region, and was derived from P(Activation|Task) as well as
P(Task) and P(Activation) using Bayes’ rule. Significance (at P <
0.05, corrected for multiple comparisons using false discovery
rate) was assessed by means of a chi-squared test. Specifically,
for each Behavioural Domain and Paradigm Class category, the
number of activation foci associated with this meta-data category was assessed within a seed volume (an MPM of a given
pACC area), and compared against the number of foci which
would be expected for this category given the entire database.
The expected number of foci for a category was determined by
multiplying the total number of foci for the current category
with the proportion of foci in BrainMap located within the
respective seed volume.

### Results

##### Relationship Between Areal Borders and Macroscopic Landmarks

Macroscopic landmarks provide an orientation point for some of
the borders within the pACC region, though only when moving
from the corpus callosum to the superior margin of the hemisphere, as described in the following paragraphs. Although the


-----

callosal sulcus is a reliable marker for the caudal most portion
of pACC, no macroscopic landmarks could be associated with
the remaining “outer” borders of this region. Thus the boundaries of pACC areas with ventrally adjacent areas of the sACC
region, with the rostrally/dorsally located frontal and medial
prefrontal areas, or with the caudally following midcingulate
areas can only be identified by cytoarchitectonic analysis (Fig. 2).
The lateral border of p24a, where it abuts area 33, was
always located within the callosal sulcus. The degree to
which p24a encroached onto the surface of the cingulate
gyrus, where it abuts p24b, varied depending on the depth of
the callosal sulcus. Area p24a reached its greatest extent on
the gyral surface when the callosal sulcus was particularly
shallow. The lateral border of p24b was found mainly within
the cingulate sulcus, though very close to the surface, where
it abutted area pv24c ventrally and pd24cv dorsally. Areas
p24a and p24b were merged into a “gyral component of area
p24”, i.e., area p24ab for volumetric analysis and computation
of continuous probability maps. Given the extent of areas
p24a and p24b, area p24ab always occupied the free surface of
the cingulate gyrus and encroached into the callosal and cingulate sulci.
Areas pv24c, pd24cv, and pd24cd were mostly buried within
the cingulate sulcus. Only when the sulcus was interrupted or
became extremely shallow, as was the case in the left hemispheres of cases 10, 11, and 17 (Fig. 2), did pd24cv reach the
gyral surface (Fig. 3). The border between pd24cv and pd24cd
was located in, or very close to, the fundus of the cingulate sulcus. No macroscopic landmark marked the transition from
pv24c to pd24cv. Areas pv24c, pd24cv and pd24cd were merged
into a “sulcal component of area p24”, i.e., area p24c for volumetric analysis and computation of continuous probability
maps, and this area p24c was always located within the cingulate sulcus.
The border between areas p32 and p24c was located in the
cingulate sulcus, and always within the outer third of the sulcal
wall. The border between p32 and orbitofrontal cortical areas
was found either on the gyral surface, of within the superior
rostral or paracingulate sulci, depending on their length and
course, and on whether they merged or not. Likewise, the border between p32 and adjacent frontopolar and medial prefrontal areas could be found either on a gyral surface, or within the
paracingulate sulcus, depending on both variability pertaining
the extent of the area and whether the sulcus was interrupted
or continuous. The paracingulate sulcus was present in all
20 hemispheres, but was continuous only in 5 (namely in the
left one of brains #1, #6, #10, #17 and #18), and fragmented in
the right hemisphere of cases #10 and #15 (Fig. 2). Additionally,
the paracingulate and superior rostral sulci only merged in
6 left (cases #1, #5, #6, #15, #17, and #18) and 6 right (cases #1,
#6, #10, #15, #17, and #18) hemispheres. Even when present, the
paracingulate sulcus was not a consistent marker of the border,
because at times area p32 extended further rostrally, as seen in
the right hemispheres of case #1 and #6, where p32 was clearly
visible on the surface of the inferior rostral and superior frontal
gyri, respectively (Fig. 2). Conversely, in both hemispheres of
case #5 the ventral portion of area p32 is restricted to the superior cingulate gyrus, and did not even encroach into the paracingulate sulcus (Figure 2). Finally, the position of the border
within the paracingulate sulcus was not constant, and was
found on either of its banks or close to the fundus, depending
on the hemisphere examined. Therefore, we can state that no


reliable macroscopic landmark could be consistently associated
with the outer borders of p32.

##### Volumetric Analysis

Area p32 was the largest of the pACC areas, reaching 3467 mm[3]

in the right hemisphere of male brains, whereas p24ab and
p24c were comparable in size (Table 2). Statistical analysis of
the histological volumes corrected for individual brain sizes
revealed no interhemispheric or gender differences, or interactions between gender and hemisphere in any of the examined
areas.

##### Probabilistic Maps and Variability

Areas p24ab, p24c, and p32 were registered to the MNI reference
brain in order to compute continuous probability maps and quantify intersubject variability of their size and location (Fig. 4A–C).
p32 was the least variable area, since it presented the largest
number of voxels with the highest overlap of all 10 brains, and
p24c was the area with the highest intersubject variability.
Since continuous probability maps of different adjoining
areas overlap, we computed MPMs, which present a contiguous, non-overlapping parcellation of the pACC. These MPMs
reflect, for each voxel, the most likely area at that position in a
sample of 10 human postmortem brains (Fig. 4D).

##### Task-Dependent Functional Connectivity

Task-based co-activations of p24ab, p24c, and p32 were quantitatively mapped using the BrainMap database. We found 231 experiments in the BrainMap database which described activation foci
in p24ab (a full list of the articles is provided in Supplementary reference list 1). It comprises a total of 3848 subjects and 3011 foci
(see Supplementary Fig. 1A). A total of 197 experiments (encompassing 3030 subjects and 2636 foci, Supplementary Fig. 1B)
reported activations in p24c (Supplementary reference list 2). Area
p32 was reported to be activated in 585 experiments encompassing
8590 subjects and 6832 foci (Supplementary Fig. 1C; Supplementary
reference list 3). Meta-analytic connectivity modeling of these data
revealed distinct patterns of co-activation clusters for each of the
pACC areas.
p24ab presented the most restricted co-activation pattern,
with only 3 co-activated clusters, which included both cortical
and subcortical structures (Fig. 5A, Table 3). Bilateral maxima
were located in the anterior insula, ventral posterior cingulate
cortex (vPCC), ventral striatum, and in the portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus connected with the prefrontal cortex
(MDpr). Lateralized co-activation clusters presented maxima in
the right middle frontal gyrus (dorsal to area 45), as well as in
the left posterior midcingulate cortex (pMCC), dorsal posterior
cingulate cortex (dPCC), frontal operculum, and sublenticular
part of the basal forebrain (Ch4).
p24c was associated with 7 co-activation clusters (Fig. 5B,
Table 3). Maxima were located mainly in cortical regions and, in
contrast to p24ab co-activations, were predominantly leftlateralized. Cortical bilateral maxima were found in the anterior
insula and middle frontal gyrus (dorsal and rostral to area 45),
as well as in the frontal operculum, whereas subcortically they
were restricted to the caudate nucleus. Right-lateralized maxima were found in area 45, the anterior midcingulate cortex
(aMCC), and MDpr. Maxima restricted to the left hemisphere

Data are presented as mean values computed for areas of the left and right hemispheres (independent of gender), or from male and female donors (after summing

volumes from both hemispheres, or independently for the left and right hemisphere). Volumes were measured in the reconstructed histological brain volumes prior

to spatial normalization and were individually corrected for shrinkage concomitant of histological processing.


p32 presented the most widespread pattern of co-activated
clusters, which were often lateralized, and mainly located in
the cerebral cortex (Fig. 5C, Table 3). Bilateral maxima were
restricted to area 45, the inferior rostral sulcus (rostral to area


45), the medial frontal gyrus, the laterobasal (LB) nucleus of the
amygdala, and the caudate nucleus. Within the thalamus, maxima were found in the right MDpr and the left portion of the
mediodorsal thalamic nucleus connected with the temporal

lateralized maxima, which were located only in the right hemisphere, In contrast, all lateralized cortical maxima were found
in the left hemisphere, and included frontopolar area Fp1, dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, anterior insula, inferior parietal area
PGp, pMCC, and vPCC.
Conjunction analyses revealed a certain degree of overlap of
the co-activation networks of p24ab, p24c, and p32 (Table 4).
p24ab and p24c presented common co-activation clusters bilaterally only in the anterior insula and ventral striatum. Leftlateralized maxima were identified in Fp1, frontal operculum, Ch4
and putamen, whereas right-lateralized maxima were found in


the inferior frontal sulcus (rostral to area 45), aMCC, and the
medial frontal gyrus (rostral to the premotor cortex), the caudate
and MDpr. Areas p24ab and p32 had 7 common co-activation
clusters. Bilateral maxima were found in the anterior insula, ventral striatum, putamen, and MDpr. Left-lateralized maxima were
restricted to the cingulate cortex (pMCC, dPCC, and vPCC), the
Ch4 and the hypothalamus. Maxima in the right hemisphere
were located in area 45, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex, aMCC,
the superficial group of amygdalar nuclei (SF), the LP/Pu complex,
and the caudate nucleus. Finally, functional networks of p24c and
p32 overlapped bilaterally in the anterior insular cortex, the caudate nucleus and the thalamus (MDpr and MDt). Common

maxima in the left hemisphere were found in area Fp1, the
medial frontal gyrus (rostral to premotor cortex), Ch4 (Nucl.

hemisphere were located in area 45, the premotor cortex, globus
pallidus, and putamen.


The contrast analyses revealed that p24ab showed stronger
co-activations with the claustrum, basal ganglia, and hypothalamus than did p24c or p32 (Fig. 6A and B, Table 5). Additionally,
p24ab was more strongly associated with the basal forebrain
and amygdala than was p24c (Fig. 6A). In contrast, weaker

Cluster maxima were assigned to most probable cytoarchitectonic area when present in the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al. 2005). Brain regions (in italics) or

cytoarchitectonically defined areas were identified based on previously published criteria: 44 and 45 (areas 44 and 45 of Broca’s region; (Amunts et al. 1999), aMCC
(anterior portion of the midcingulate cortex, encompasses areas a24’ and 32’; (Vogt et al. 2003; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009), anterior insular region (Kurth et al.

2010), Ch4 (sublenticular part of the basal forebrain; (Zaborszky et al. 2008), dPCC (dorsal posterior cingulate cortex; encompasses areas 23d, d23, and 31; (Vogt et al.

2006), Fp1 (frontopolar area Fp1; (Bludau et al. 2014), frontal operculum (includes opercular areas op4-op9; (Amunts et al. 2010), hIP3 (area 3 on the medial wall of the

intraparietal sulcus; (Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al. 2008; Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 200 8), ifj2 (area 2 at the inferior frontal junction region; (Amunts et al. 2010), IFS
(inferior frontal sulcus), LB (laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala; (Amunts et al. 2005), MDpr and MDt (parts of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus connected with the

prefrontal and temporal cortices, respectively; (Behrens et al. 2003), pMCC (posterior portion of the midcingulate cortex, encompasses areas p24’ and 24d; (Vogt et al.

2003; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009), premotor (premotor cortex, encompasses the rostral and caudal supplementary motor areas; (Zilles et al.1996), vPCC (ventral

posterior cingulate cortex; encompasses areas v23 and 31; (Vogt et al. 2006), WM (white matter). Coordinates are given in anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al. 2005).


co-activations of p24ab than of either p24c or p32 were
restricted to the cerebral cortex. p24c was found to be more
strongly activated with area 45 and the premotor cortex in the
right hemisphere, as well as with areas 44, ifj2, hIP2, and hIP3
in the left hemisphere than was p24ab. Furthermore, p24ab
was more strongly associated with the anterior insula in the
left hemisphere than was p24c, and the opposite holds true
for the right hemisphere. p24ab and p24c presented a differential connectivity with the cingulate cortex. Specifically, p24ab
showed stronger co-activation patterns with areas s24 and p32
of the anterior cingulate cortex as well as with vPCC pMCC, but
a weaker association with aMCC than did p24c. When comparing the cortical co-activation patterns of p24ab and p32 (Fig. 6B,
Table 5), the former was found to be more strongly activated
with the anterior insula (bilaterally), and the latter with area 45
on the right hemisphere as well as with inferior parietal areas
PFm, PGa and PGp on the left hemisphere. p24ab and p32 also
presented a differential connectivity with the cingulate cortex,
since p24ab was more strongly associated with aMCC, pMCC
and dPCC in the left hemisphere, and p32 with vPCC in the
right hemisphere. Contrast analyses between p24c and p32
revealed a more widespread network for the former area (Fig.
6C, Table 5). p24c presented stronger co-activations than p32 in
the anterior insula, putamen and globus pallidus bilaterally, in
area 45, the aMCC, caudate nucleus, MDpr, and MDt of the right
hemisphere, as well as in areas 44, ifj2, hIP2, and hIP3, and in


the premotor cortex of the left hemisphere. Stronger activations of p32 than of p24c were found in the superior frontal
gyrus, frontal operculum laterobasal amygdalar nuclei and the
cornu ammonis region 1 (CA1) of the hippocampus.

##### Functional Characterization of sACC Areas

A functional decoding analysis based on the BrainMap metadata was performed to outline the functional profiles of the
seed volumes of interest defined by the MPMs of p24ab, p24c,
and p32. Furthermore, we determined the functional domains
and Paradigm Classes with which they could be significantly
associated (Fig. 7). As specified in the Material and Methods
section, results were only considered robust in the case of congruent forward and reverse inferences.
All 3 areas were significantly associated with the Behavioural
Domains of emotion (i.e., the mental faculty of experiencing an
affective state of consciousness) and cognition (i.e., mental process of knowing, including the integration of awareness, perception, reasoning, and judgment) and were activated by paradigms
involving monitoring and decision making, such as the reward
task (Fig. 7). Only p24ab was specifically associated with the perception of taste and the awareness of physiological sensations
specifically related to sexuality, although both p24ab and p24c
were activated by tasks involving taste. Only p24c was significantly linked with the ability to prevent any form of planned

Cluster maxima assigned to most probable cytoarchitectonic area when present in the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al. 2005). Brain regions (in italics) or

cytoarchitectonically defined areas were identified based on previously published criteria: 45 (area 45 of Broca’s region; Amunts et al. 1999), aMCC (anterior portion of
the midcingulate cortex, encompasses areas a24’ and 32’; Vogt et al. 2003; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009), anterior insular region (Kurth et al. 2010), Ch4 (sublenticular

part of the basal forebrain; Zaborszky et al. 2008), dPCC (dorsal posterior cingulate cortex; encompasses areas 23d, d23, and 31; Vogt et al. 2006), Fp1 (frontopolar area

Fp1; Bludau et al. 2014), frontal operculum (includes opercular areas op4-op9; Amunts et al. 2010), IFS (inferior frontal sulcus), MDpr and MDt (parts of the mediodorsal

thalamic nucleus connected with the prefrontal and temporal cortices, respectively; Behrens et al. 2003), pMCC (posterior portion of the midcingulate cortex, encompasses areas p24’ and 24d; Vogt et al. 2003; Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2009), premotor (premotor cortex, encompasses the rostral and caudal supplementary motor

areas; Zilles et al.1996 ), SF (superficial group of amygdala nuclei; Amunts et al. 2005), vPCC (ventral posterior cingulate cortex; encompasses areas v23 and 31; Vogt

et al. 2006). Coordinates are given in anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al. 2005).


motor response. Only p32 was associated with the more specific
domains of emotion pertaining the processing of anxiety or fear,
and those of cognition related to the individual’s ability to
engage in social interactions, as well as to perceive, evaluate,
respond to, and communicate in a language about bodily sensations, feelings, thoughts and experiences (Fig. 7). Indeed, p32
was activated by the theory of mind task, which probes the
volunteer’s ability to understand the personal beliefs and feelings of another person, or form hypotheses regarding the mental states of others. Furthermore, p32 was not only involved in
emotion induction tasks, but was also activated by cognitive
processes associated with monitoring and decision making such
as the reward, episodic recall, and lexical decision tasks.
Surprisingly, we did not find a significant association
between any of the pACC areas and the subjective state of pleasure, although at the time of the study the BrainMap database
contained a total of 124 studies reporting tasks belonging to the
behavioral domain happiness. However, only a very small
number of these experiments reported activation foci within
p24ab, p24c, and/or p32. Specifically, 5 of these studies (encompassing 81 subjects and 32 activation foci) reported activations
within p24ab, 2 studies (encompassing 55 subjects and 24 activation foci) involved p24c, and 10 studies (encompassing 140
subjects and 87 activation foci) found activation within p32.

### Discussion

The present study provides the first probability maps in stereotaxic space of cytoarchitectonic areas p24ab, p24c, and p32, which
were previously identified based on observer-independent quantitative criteria (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008), and sheds new
light on the functions of the pACC region based on the results of
a database-driven meta-analytic connectivity modeling and


quantitative functional decoding approach. We generated continuous and MPMs of areas p24ab (encompassing gyral cytoarchitectonic areas p24a and p24b), p24c (encompassing cytoarchitectonic
areas pv24c, pd24cv and pd24cd of the cingulate sulcus) and
p32 (covers cytoarchitectonic area p32). Each of the MPMs was
then used as a seed volume for a database-driven analysis
of task-dependent functional connectivity and functional decoding in order to infer the area’s functions and its interactions
with other brain regions. Areas p24ab and p24c shared a
common functional profile involving the cognition and emotion
Behavioural Domains, and were activated by reward tasks. Area
p24a was specifically associated with the domains of gustation
and interoception, and p24c with that of action inhibition.
Additionally, p32 was associated with the specific domains of
social cognition, anxiety and fear, and was specifically activated
by paradigms probing for emotion induction and theory of mind.
Notably, we did not find a significant association between any
of the pACC areas and the subjective state of pleasure. Metaanalytic connectivity modeling revealed significant differences in
the co-activation patterns of the 3 areas. p24ab presented the
most restricted co-activation pattern, but also the strongest association with subcortical structures, and p24c had the most widespread functional connectivity pattern. Additionally, all 3 areas
were found to be co-activated with components of the executive
(Seeley et al. 2007), and default mode (Greicius et al. 2003;
Fox, Snyder, et al. 2005; Fransson and Marrelec 2008) networks.
Additionally, we could demonstrate that p24ab and p24c coactivated with elements of the salience network (Seeley et al.
2007), p24ab with parts of the affective network (George et al.
1995; Lévesque et al. 2003), and p32 with regions belonging to
the cognitive (Seeley et al. 2007) and theory of mind (Abu-Akel
and Shamay-Tsoory 2011; Schurz et al. 2014; Spunt and Adolphs

Areas p24ab and p24c: frontopolar area Fp2 (1), subgenual cingulate area s24 (2), the frontal operculum (3), the medial frontal gyrus (4), the aMCC, (5), the anterior

insula (6), area 45 (7), area 44 (8), the premotor cortex (9), the inferior frontal sulcus (10), the putamen (11), the claustrum (12), magnocellular nuclei of the basal fore

We found no interhemispheric or gender differences in the
size of pACC areas after correction for differences in total brain
size. These volumetric findings are difficult to correlate with
previous results from the literature, because they mostly report
data obtained from the portion of the cingulate gyrus which covers the pACC and the MCC portions of the cingulate gyrus (e.g.,
Makris et al. 2010; Seidman et al. 2006), or with regions of interest restricted to the perigenual portion of the cingulate gyrus,
but covering the entire cingulate gyrus (e.g., Sturm et al. 2013),
and thus cover our area p24ab together with the portion of our
p24c located on the posterior/ventral bank of the cingulate
gyrus. Furthermore, although in their Table 3, Sturm et al. (2013)
report a larger volume of their region of interest in the left than
in the right hemisphere (1722.9 ± 329.8 vs. 2310 ± 449.4 mm[3]),
they did not specify whether this result was significant.

##### The pACC and Happiness

Contrary to the view that the pACC subserves the processing of
happiness and sACC that of sadness (Vogt et al. 2003), we did
not find any cytoarchitectonic subdivision of pACC to be significantly linked to positively valenced emotions. Our results
should not be interpreted in the sense that the pACC region is
not involved in the processing of happiness, since when we specifically queried the BrainMap database for tasks belonging to
the behavioral domain “happiness”, we found a total of 124
studies. However, only 5 of them reported activations within
p24ab, 2 involved p24c, and 10 found a activations within p32,
and there was not a significant convergence of activations
within pACC areas compared with those located in other brain
regions. Our results are in accordance with several previously
published meta-analytic studies using quantitative or traditional literature search strategies which also failed to allocate
the processing of positively valenced emotions to a specific cingulate region, or even to the cingulate gyrus (e.g., Phan et al.
2002; Vytal and Hamann 2010; Torta and Cauda 2011; Kirby and
Robinson 2017). Thus, although the pACC by all means participates in the processing of positively valenced emotions, it cannot be categorized as being a “central hub” (van den Heuvel
and Sporns 2013) in the network processing happiness
(Salzman and Fusi 2010). The present result also highlights the
advantage of the MACM approach agnostic to the focus of
included experiments in contrast to meta-analyses which rely
on a literature search for relevant publications by means of
specific functional keywords pertaining to the research question. Whereas the latter approach is inherently selective and
thus limited in its’ generalizability, the former provides a more
comprehensive functional characterization of brain regions
(Eickhoff and Bzdok 2013) given that the BrainMap database is
currently one of the most comprehensive neuroimaging databases. Finally, although a clear-cut attribution of a cognitive
function to a Behavioural Domain or Paradigm Class is often
difficult, as it might encompass a very wide range of concepts,
attribution to subdomains (in our case that of “happiness”)
yields a much higher accuracy (Lancaster et al. 2012).


##### Functional Fingerprint and Connectivity of p24ab

Area p24ab was significantly associated with the global
Behavioural Domains of cognition and emotion, as well as with
the specific perception and interoception domains. It coactivated with components of the salience and executivecontrol (Seeley et al. 2007) networks such as the anterior insula,
frontal operculum, and aMCC. Furthermore, p24ab was more
strongly associated with the hypothalamus (included in the
salience network; Seeley et al. 2007) than was p24c. It also coactivated with the PCC, a component of the default mode network (Greicius et al. 2003; Fox, Snyder, et al. 2005; Fransson and
Marrelec 2008), and with areas Fp2, Fo1, s24, s32 and p32, which
are part the affective network (George et al. 1995; Lévesque
et al. 2003). These functional connectivity patterns and the
association of p24ab with the Behavioural Domains of perception and interoception provide further evidence for the crosstalk taking place between ACC, the anterior insula, and the
hypothalamus during the processing of bodily awareness and the
control of neural homeostasis involving the sympathetic nervous
system (Craig 2002, 2009). Furthermore, our results pinpoint p24ab
as the specific cytoarchitectonic entity within the ACC subserving
such functions. p24ab was also co-activated with the basal forebrain, the major source of cholinergic afferents to the cortex
(Mufson et al. 2003). Although functional connectivity does not
necessarily imply direct anatomical connections (Eickhoff and
Grefkes 2011), in this case it may reflect direct input from the
basal forebrain as determined by tracer studies in rhesus monkey
(Koliatsos et al. 1988) and rodent (Zaborszky et al. 2015; Fillinger
et al. 2017) brains. Furthermore, in the mouse brain it could be
shown that areas 24a and 24b receive qualitatively similar input
from the basal forebrain, albeit with different densities (Fillinger
et al. 2017). Our results confirm, and expand, a previous study
reporting a strong functional connectivity of the basal nucleus of
Meynert and the ACC in humans (Li et al. 2014), and highlights
the modulatory role of the cholinergic system on activity of
brain regions controlling our motor response to the occurrence of
salient stimuli.

##### Functional Fingerprint and Connectivity of p24c

Area p24c was significantly associated with the global Behavioural Domains of cognition and emotion, and with the specific action
inhibition Behavioural Domain. It co-activated with diverse components of the salience and executive-control (Seeley et al. 2007)
networks: anterior insula, frontal operculum, pMCC, inferior frontal gyrus (more extensively in the right than in the left hemisphere), and premotor cortex. The specific association of p24c
with the action inhibition Behavioural Domain as well as its coactivation with the anterior insula and with multiple areas of the
ventral prefrontal cortex, provide further support for the hypothesis that the inferior fontal gyrus is not the sole region implementing inhibitory control (Aron et al. 2004, 2014), but that activation
of an extensive network is required for motor response inhibition
(Levy and Wagner 2011; Hampshire and Sharp 2015). We also
found p24c to co-activate with the ventral striatum, which is part
of the salience, but not the executive network (Seeley et al. 2007),


with the temporal cortex (MDt, 11), ventral posterior cingulate cortex (dPCC, 12), as well as parietal areas PFm (13), PGa (14), and PGp (15). Areas p24c and p32: pars tri
angularis of the inferior frontal gyrus (1), gyrus rectus (2), superior frontal gyrus (3), middle frontal gyrus (4), area 44 (5), area 45 (6), premotor cortex (7), anterior insula
(8), caudate nucleus (9), putamen (10), area ifj2 (11), globus pallidus (12), laterobasal nucleus of the amygdala (LB, 13), cornu ammonis region of the hippocampus (CA,

14), portion of the mediodorsal thalamic nucleus connected with the prefrontal cortex (MDpr, 15), intraparietal area 3 (hIP3, 16), ventral posterior cingulate cortex

(vPCC, 17), and parietal area PGp (18). Stereotaxic coordinates are given in anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al. 2005). Cluster sizes and assignations are specified in

and has been involved in sensorimotor gating and motivational
behavior (Root et al. 2015), as well as with intraparietal areas hIP2
and hIP3, which, together with the premotor cortex, are part of
the sensorimotor network enabling the brain coordination and/or
mediation of motor tasks (Ferri et al. 2012). Given the functional
connectivity and Behavioural Domain patterns of p24c, one may
speculate its role as an integrative hub mediate emotional influences and coordinating motor response, error detection and reorienting processes during events requiring focused attention and
sequential information processing.

##### Functional Fingerprint and Connectivity of p32

Area p32 was associated with a wider range of Behavioural
Domains and paradigms than p24ab or p24c. In particular,
p32 was significantly activated by higher mental functions
such as the theory of mind task, i.e., with cognitive empathy
(Walter 2012), and was associated with the specific social
cognition Behavioural Domain. The dorsomedial prefrontal cortex
constitutes one of the core components of the theory of mind
network (Carrington and Bailey 2009; Abu-Akel and ShamayTsoory 2011; Schurz et al. 2014; Spunt and Adolphs 2017), and has
been subdivided into clusters by means of functional connectivity
profiling (Eickhoff, Laird et al. 2016). Area p32 is located at a
macroanatomical position on the medial prefrontal cortex comparable to that of the caudal most of these clusters. Furthermore,


we also found p32 to be co-activated with the remaining core
components of the theory of mind network (Abu-Akel and
Shamay-Tsoory 2011; Schurz et al. 2014; Spunt and Adolphs 2017),
which are also part of the default mode network (Greicius et al.
2003; Fox, Snyder, et al. 2005; Fransson and Marrelec 2008), i.e.,
with cytoarchitectonic areas PGa and PGp of the temporo-parietal
junction region (Caspers et al. 2006) and with the PCC. In particular the functional connectivity of p32 and areas PGa and PGp is
thought to subserve the updating mental representations of the
current context and their integration with the appropriate motor
response (Geng and Vossel 2013).
Interestingly, p32 was also significantly associated with the
emotion Behavioural Domains of fear and anxiety, in accordance with previous meta-analytical studies (Phan et al. 2002;
Vytal and Hamann 2010; Kirby and Robinson 2017). A closer
look at the Paradigm Classes resulting in this association demonstrated that it was not due to activations occurring during
the actual emotional experience, but by emotion induction
tasks pertaining to the anxiety, fear, and sadness subdomains
of emotion processing. Thus, p32 seems to play a crucial role in
the cognitive regulation of emotion, but not in the activations
occurring during the actual processing of emotionally valenced
stimuli. Area p32 is thought to be a key player in the neural circuit subserving the renewal of extinguished fear memory,
whereby it serves node which integrates contextual information from hippocampal inputs, and projects this information to

the amygdala, thus enabling context-dependent fear responses
(Chen et al. 2017). Additionally, our contrast analyses of the
functional connectivity pattern of p32 also revealed that it
was strongly associated with both the amygdala and the CA1
region of the hippocampus, probably reflecting true anatomical
connectivity, as seen in non-human primate and rodent brains.
Indeed, in macaque monkeys area 32 receives efferents
from the CA1 region (Vogt and Pandya 1987; Insausti and
Muñoz 2001; Yukie and Shibata 2009); and is reciprocally connected with the amygdala (Van Hoesen 1981; Amaral and Price
1984; Stefanacci and Amaral 2000; Yukie and Shibata 2009). In
rodents the infralimbic cortex—i.e., the putative homolog of
human area 32 (Vogt et al. 2013)—is targeted by robust afferents
from the CA1 region (Jay and Witter 1991), and projects to the
amygdala (Buchanan et al. 1994; Hoover and Vertes 2007). We
also found a strong association of p32 with the mediodorsal
thalamic nucleus. Specifically, with MDpr and MDt, as defined
in the human brain by Behrens et al. (2003) using diffusion
imaging data. Association of p32 with MDpr is not surprising
given that the mediodorsal nucleus is reciprocally connected
with the prefrontal cortex (e.g., Tobias 1975; Tanaka 1976; Vogt
et al. 1987). Since diffusion weighted imaging is sensitive only
to the orientation of fiber tracts, but not to their polarity, connectivity between the mediodorsal nucleus and the temporal
pole is thought (Behrens et al. 2003) to reflect efferents to this
part of the thalamus from the amygdala, temporal pole, and
inferior temporal areas TE and TEO (Aggleton and Mishkin
1984; Russchen et al. 1987; Webster et al. 1993). Finally,
although efferents from area 32 to the posterior orbitofrontal
cortex have been described in the monkey brain (Garcia

Cabezas and Barbas 2017), we found no significant coactivation pattern between p32 and orbitofrontal areas. This
could be a false negative finding resulting from the frequently
described difficulties with echo planar imaging related distortions and signal dropout in the orbitofrontal cortex.

##### Cytoarchitectonic and Functional Gradations Within ACC

Areas within the ACC present a clear cytoarchitectonic gradation (Sanides 1962) when moving from area 33 either through
the subdivisions of area s24 (s24a, s24b) into area s32, or
through the subdivisions of area p24 (p24a, p24b, pd24cv,
pd24cd) into s32 (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008). An additional
gradation is seen when moving from area 25 through the areas
within sACC into those of pACC (Palomero-Gallagher et al.
2008). Both gradations are characterized by an increasing differentiation of the cortical lamination, and this is particularly true
for the changes occurring in the caudal-to-rostral direction.
Area 33 presents the most “primitive” cytoarchitectonic organization within the ACC, since no distinct layers can be distinguished (Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008). Area 33 is followed in
the callosal sulcus by periallocortical agranular areas s24 and
p24, characterized by a particularly prominent layer V which is
easily delineable from layers III and VI due to the large densely
packed pyramids as in Va and the cell sparse Vb. Areas s24 and
p24 are followed by dysgranular isocortical areas s32 and p32,
respectively, each with a considerably less prominent layer V
(Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008). The changes in lamination
when moving from areas of the sACC dorsally into areas of the


-----

pACC are more subtle, and mostly restricted to gradation differences in the size of layer III pyramids (Palomero-Gallagher
et al. 2008). Whereas in areas of s24 layer III contains clearly
larger pyramids near the surface than at the border with layer
V, in p24 layer III pyramids only taper down slightly in size
when approaching layer V. Likewise, layer IIIc pyramids of area
p32 are larger than those of area s32 (Palomero-Gallagher et al.
2008).
These 2 cytoarchitectonic gradation directions (when moving from the callosal sulcus to the convexity of the hemisphere,
or when moving from sACC into pACC), and the increasing
complexity in the degree of lamination they entail, are paralleled by gradual changes in the cognitive demand associated
with the tasks activating the different sACC and pACC areas.
All cytoarchitectonic areas of the ACC could be associated with
the processing of emotions (present results and PalomeroGallagher et al. 2015). However, whereas areas of the sACC are
activated during the subjective perception of the body state or
the actual experiencing of negatively valenced emotions
(Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2015), we here found the areas of the
pACC to be associated with tasks requiring associative
processes requiring an increasing integration of information
processing levels. Thus, area p24ab was linked to the phenomenological experience of the body state, which involves the integration of somatic information pertaining all aspects of the
body’s physiological condition with subjective time perception
and emotional memories (Craig 2002; Wiens 2005; Ceunen et al.
2016). Area p24c was specifically associated with the inhibition
of action, i.e., the suppression of unwanted reflex-like actions
and the control of voluntary movement, which requires the
coordination of processes associated with sustained and selective attention, motor timing and withdrawal of a planned
response (Faw 2003; Miller and Wallis 2009). Finally, p32 was
significantly associated with processes ultimately resulting in
the ability to mentalize the emotions of others, i.e., to experience empathy (Walter 2012). Area p32 was activated by emotion induction tasks pertaining negatively valenced stimuli as
well as by tasks probing the subject’s ability to evaluate,
respond to, and provide verbal information about bodily sensations, feelings, thoughts and experiences. More importantly,
p32 was also associated with the ability to share another’s
internal world of thoughts and feelings. Thus, area p32 could
be classified as cingulate association cortex playing a crucial
role in the cognitive regulation of emotion.
