**FIG. 1.** Cytoarchitectonic maps of Brodmann from 1909 (lateral and medial view; A) and of v.Economo and Koskinas from 1925 (lateral
and medial views; B). Brodmann’s area 17 corresponds approximately to v. Economo and Koskinas’ area OC, Brodmann’s area 18—to their OB.

1991; Kaas and Krubitzer, 1991; Zeki, 1993). This
nomenclature is widely accepted in imaging studies in
man (Lueck et al., 1989; Malach et al., 1995; Shipp et
_al., 1995; Ungerleider, 1995; Sereno et al., 1995; Tootell_
_et al., 1995a; Tootell and Taylor, 1995b; Aine et al.,_
1996; Kleinschmidt et al., 1996; Engel et al., 1997;
Larsson et al., 1998; Portin et al., 1998). The primary
visual area V1 corresponds to area 17. V2 is located
next to V1 and may correspond roughly to area 18
(Clarke, 1993). However, we do not know whether
cytoarchitectonic areas 17/18 correspond precisely to
areas V1/2. For higher visual areas (e.g., V3, V3A, V4,
V5) it seems impossible to correlate classical cytoarchitectonic descriptions in man with functional imaging
studies (Kaas, 1995). At least area 19 and perhaps area
18 need to be further subdivided. Initial studies have
suggested also that human and simian cortical organization may begin to differ in extrastriate cortex at, or
beyond, V3A and V4 (DeYoe et al., 1996). Clarification
would require an overlay of cytoarchitectonic areas
with functionally defined areas in a common reference
system Despite the mismatch between the tripartition


of the visual cortex in Brodmann’s map and the recent
functional and experimental data, the classical maps
are still widely used for the anatomical interpretation
of imaging data in man.
The maps in Fig. 1 present mainly surface-based
information on the location and size of visual areas in
relation to gyri and sulci. The idea of whether and/or to
what extent architectonic areas are associated with
sulci and gyri has been disputed even since Brodmann
published his famous map (Brodmann, 1909; Riegele,
1931; Filimonoff, 1932; Sanides, 1963; Rademacher et
_al., 1993; Amunts et al., 1999a). Therefore, the simple_
assignment of functional data to particular cytoarchitectonic areas on the basis of anatomical landmarks
remains enigmatic. Finally, the individual variability
in size, location, and structure of visual cortical areas is
not considered either in the maps of Brodmann, v.Economo and Koskinas, and Sarkisov or in the Talairach
atlas (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). This problem can
be solved only by applying an anatomical atlas system
which is based on a probabilistic approach (Roland and
Zilles 1994; Mazziotta et al 1995) Such systems are

volunteers (Zilles et al., 1995; Geyer et al., 1996; Roland
and Zilles, 1996; Gulyas et al., 1997; Larsson et al.,
1997; Amunts et al., 1998; Larsson et al., 1997, 1998) as
well as in clinical research (Thompson et al., 1998).
The aim of this study was
(a) to create cytoarchitectonic maps of areas 17 and
18 from serial histological sections of 10 human brains
using a statistical approach for defining borders,
(b) to transfer these maps into the three-dimensional
stereotaxic space of the standard reference brain,
(c) to define the spatial extent and location of each
area in the standard system, and
(d) to analyze intersubject variability.

**MATERIAL AND METHODS**

Ten human brains were examined: five male and five
female brains ranging in age from 37 to 85 years (Table
1). The brains were obtained from body donor programs. The autopsy was performed within 8 to 24 h
after death. Brain 3 came from a subject with transitory motor disturbances, all the other subjects had no
medical history of neurological or psychiatric diseases.
Handedness of the subjects was unknown. Considering
an incidence of right-handedness in approximately 90%
of the population (Gilbert and Wysocki, 1992), most of
our cases will have been right-handed.
After the brains were removed from the skull they
were fixed in 4% formalin (cases 2–8) or in Bodian, a
mixture of formalin, glacial acetic acid, and ethanol
(remaining cases). Brains were hung up by their vertebral arteries in the fixative in a freely movable manner,
which enabled a minimum of distortions in brain
shape. The meninges were removed after several
months of fixation. MR imaging was carried out as
previously described and validated (Roland and Zilles,
1994; Zilles et al., 1995; Amunts et al., 1996; Geyer et
_al., 1996). Imaging was performed with a Siemens_
1.5-T magnet (Erlangen, Germany) with a T1-weighted

angle 40°, repetition time TR � 40 ms, echo time
TE � 5 ms for each image). Each volume consisted of
128 sagittal sections. The spatial resolution was 1 �
1 � 1.17 mm (Steinmetz et al., 1990). The image space
was divided into voxels in the form of rectangular
parallepipeds of uniform size, each with a resolution of
8 bits corresponding to 256 gray values. The image
sequences were 3-D reconstructed.
The brains were then embedded in paraffin and
sectioned in the coronal plane through both hemispheres. From brains 1–4, the cerebellum and the brain
stem were removed above the mesencephalon prior to
embedding. The others were processed in toto. From
each brain 6000–7500 sections (20 µm) were acquired.
Each 15th section was mounted on glass slides and
silver stained for perikarya (Merker, 1983). In brains 1
and 2, in addition to the sections stained for cell bodies,
neighboring sections were stained for myelin (Gallyas,
1979). Each 60th section of the entire series was used
for analysis. Images of the histological sections were
digitized and 3-D reconstructed. The 3-D reconstructions were matched to the MR sequences of the brains,
which were obtained prior to embedding and sectioning. This enabled us to exclude inevitable distortions
caused by histological techniques such as by sectioning
and by mounting on glasses. Matching was performed
by using both linear and nonlinear fluid transformations (Schormann et al., 1993, 1995; Schormann and
Zilles, 1997, 1998, 1999). Nonlinear fluid transformations were applied for matching the 3-D reconstructions to the MR sequences of the brains. Finally, brains
were warped to the standard format of the reference
brain (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996, 1998) using affine
transformations, i.e., only shifting, scaling, and rotating. The orientation of the brains was in the plane
determined by the anterior–posterior commissures, i.e.,
the AC-PC plane (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Images
of all brains were divided into sequences for the left and the
righthemispheres.Fromimagesofbrains5–10,thecerebellum was removed in order to expose the mesial surface.
Surface rendering of the image sequences was performed using the software AVS (Uniras).
Cytoarchitectonic analysis was performed by measuring the gray level index (GLI) in regions of interest
(ROIs). The GLI (Zilles et al., 1986; Schleicher and
Zilles, 1990) is a measure of the volume fraction of
somata per volume unit brain tissue. It is highly
correlated with cell density (Wree et al., 1982). The
ROIs covered those parts of the cortex in which a
cytoarchitectonic border was microscopically apparent.
ROI size varied in dependence on cortical thickness and
sulcal properties up to approximately 1.5–2 cm[2]. Measurements were performed using an image analyzer
(KS400; Zeiss) connected to a microscope with a motor
stage for automated scanning and focussing Digitized


-----

and printed. The GLI of each pixel in these images
represents the volume fraction occupied by cell bodies
in a square measuring field of 32 � 32 µm (Figs. 2–4).
Laminar changes in cortical cell density were registered as GLI profiles from the border between layers I
and II to the border between cortex and white matter.
The profiles were oriented along trajectories running
parallel to the orientation of cell columns, i.e., perpendicular to the cortical surface. Profiles covered the
cortex in the ROIs at equidistant intervals of approximately 128 µm. The positions of profiles were numbered consecutively from 1 to n, where n was the
number of profiles per ROI. The laminar pattern of
each GLI profile was characterized by a set of 10
features (�feature vector) based on central moments
(Pearson, 1936; Dixon et al., 1988). The features included the mean GLI value, the center of gravity in axis
of the cortical depth, the standard deviation, the skewness, the kurtosis, and the analogous parameters for
the first derivative of each profile (Amunts et al., 1997;
Schleicher et al., 1999).
The observer-independent definition of borders
(Schleicher et al., 1998, 1999) is based on the assumption that the laminar pattern of the GLI is similar
within a cytoarchitectonic area, but changes abruptly
at the border between two areas. Using feature vectors,
we performed a multivariate statistical analysis between two neighboring blocks of profiles in order to
detect differences between the blocks in the laminar
pattern. A non-Euclidean distance function, the Mahalanobis distance function, has been applied for quantifying laminar differences. The blocks were shifted simultaneously in steps of one profile over the entire cortical
region of interest. The distance between neighboring
profiles and, thus, the step width was approximately
128 µm. The Mahalanobis distance D[2] was calculated
continuously for each position of the blocks in order to
quantify the degree of differences in the laminar patterns (Figs. 2–4). Previous studies have shown that the
block size, i.e., the width of a block, does not influence
the appearance and the position of detected borders in a
large interval (Fig. 3). A subsequent Hotellings’ t[2] test
was applied for testing the significance of D[2] (�� 0.05
for all tests). The higher the D[2] value between two
blocks of profiles, the greater the differences in the
laminar patterns, and vice versa, the lower the D[2], the
more similar the profiles. Borders between cytoarchitectonic areas were defined at positions at which differences in the laminar patterns were significant (Schleicher et al., 1999).
The interpretation of cortical entities was performed
mainly on the basis of v.Economo and Koskinas’ map
(1925). Their descriptions were more detailed than
those of Brodmann (1903, 1909) and were based on
several brains The area OC of v Economo and Koskinas


to the striate area of Elliot Smith (1907). Their OB
corresponds to Brodmann’s and our area 18 and to the
parastriate area of Elliot Smith. As we mentioned in
the Introduction, the concept of area 19 in man as
proposed by Brodmann (1909) clearly needs to be
revised. But, at present, there are no exhaustive anatomical maps of the human visual cortex as there are
for the monkey (Fellemann and v.Essen, 1991). For
practical reasons therefore, we use for the region which
surrounds area 18 the term ‘‘area 19,’’ knowing that it
encompasses several higher visual areas.
The positions of areas 17 and 18 in the histological
sections were transferred onto their computerized images. Images of both areas were 3-D reconstructed and
transferred into the corresponding images of the whole
brains (Figs. 5 and 6). Surface rendering of the brains
was performed using the software AVS (Uniras, Germany). Areas 17 and 18 were aligned to the standard
format of the reference brain using the same affine
transformations as were applied for the whole brains
(see above). The spatial resolution of the images in
standard brain format is 1 � 1 � 1 mm. In a final step,
areas 17 and 18 were overlapped in the 3-D stereotaxic
space of the reference brain. The volumes of areas 17
and 18 in the standard reference system were calculated and compared between hemispheres and sexes
(two-way ANOVA with repeated measurements design;
_P �_ 0.05). Mean volumes of both cytoarchitectonic areas were calculated by averaging individual volumes.
Since the mean volumes were calculated in the standard space, they are normalized, but the application of
only linear tools for the alignment of the areas maintained their individuality in volume and shape.
The extent of each area in the coronal, sagittal, and
horizontal axis was calculated in Talairach coordinates
(Table 2) and averaged over the entire sample. The
coordinates of both areas were compared with those of
the Talairach/Tournoux atlas (Talairach and Tournoux,
1988). Centers of gravity were compared for both areas
and hemispheres using a two-way ANOVA with repeated-measurements design and subsequent Bonferroni t test (P � 0.01). The number of overlapping brains
per voxel was calculated and color coded. The representations of all areas 17 and 18 in the format of the
standard reference brain are called ‘‘probability maps’’
or ‘‘population maps’’ (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996).
Such maps are shown for areas 17 and 18 in Fig. 7. The
50% volumes were defined as all those voxels of the
probability map which belong to 5 or more of the 10
brains.

**RESULTS**

The borders between areas 17 and 18, and between
18 and neighboring higher visual areas were defined in


-----

ences between the shapes of cell density profiles in
areas 17 and 18 using multivariate statistical analysis.
The distance function showed maximal values if the
profiles were located at either side of an areal border.
The laminar distribution pattern of cell bodies, i.e., the
feature vectors, differed significantly (P � 0.05) between areas 17 and 18, as well as between area 18 and
the higher visual areas in all samples (Figs. 2–4). In
only approximately 2% of the cases did a significant
‘‘border,’’ detected by the automated procedure, need to
be rejected.Abrupt changes in the orientation of the cell
columns and/or histological artifacts which alter the
laminar pattern had been detected. They were always
easily recognizable and showed up clearly localizable in
the distance function curve.
Although the positions of borders of areas 17 and 18
were mapped by applying a statistical approach for the
definition of borders, the identification of the area
between two borders was based on criteria which have
been described in the classical cytoarchitectonic studies
(Brodmann, 1903; v.Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Filimonoff, 1932). Area 17 contained a prominent layer IV
which could be further subdivided into three sublayers.
Layers III and V were characterized by small cells.
Layer V appeared light and was easily distinguished
from the dark layer VI. The layering of this area was
very distinct. The area was limited to the ventral limb
of the calcarine sulcus only in the most rostral sections.
The border of area 17 was always easy to identify: layer
IV became considerably thinner when moving from
area 17 to area 18 and its subdivision into three
sublayers stopped abruptly (Fig. 2).
In area 18, layer II bordered indistinctly upon the
upper part of layer III, which was cell dense. The size of
the pyramidal cells of layer III was increased from the
upper to the lower levels. Large cells in deep layer III
were found immediately after the border from 17 to 18
was crossed. Single cells of similar size were present in
layer V. The contrast in density between layers V and
VI was not as high as in area 17. Layer IV was thinner
than in area 17, but thicker than in the higher visual
areas. The clarity of the columnar arrangement in the
areas increased from 17 over 18 to the higher visual
areas. This feature was of special importance for the
border of area 18 to higher visual areas.
Several cytoarchitectonic changes could be found at
the border of areas 17/18 which did not coincide with
the one in layer IV. For example, the orientation of cell
columns toward the pial surface was lost in a small
zone of area 17 which was located immediately in front
of the border to area 18. Layers III and IV were
especially involved. In addition, layer VI became as
dense as in area 18 before the abrupt change in layer IV
occurred i e in the last portion of area 17 A small zone


beginning of area 18. The cells in this zone were less
densely packed than in the remaining part of area 18.
We compared the cytoarchitectonic transition zone
between areas 17 and 18 with its myeloarchitecture in
two brains. The transition was characterized by two
regions (Lungwitz, 1937; Sanides and Vitzhum,
1965a,b). Subarea Gb (border tuft, i.e., ‘‘Grenzbu¨schel’’)
had a distinct bundle of myelinated radial fibers located
at the beginning of area 18. When moving in the
direction of the 17/18 border, the myeloarchitecture as
well as the cytoarchitecture underwent gradual changes.
This part of area 17 was called ‘‘fringe area,’’ i.e.
‘‘Randsaum’’ (Rs) (Fig. 2B).
In correspondence to this heterogeneity of areas 17
and 18 in myeloarchitecture (e.g., fringe area, border
tuft), we found further significant borders within each
area in the sections stained for cell bodies. They
subdivided 17 and 18 into two or more parts. Each of
them extended approximately 3–8 mm along the cortical surface (for examples, see Figs. 2 and 3). These
internal borders were not caused by technical artifacts
and could be identified on adjacent sections. In some
cases, they were found at the transition between the
crown and the wall of a gyrus (e.g., border within area
18 at positions 60 and 74 in Figs. 2 and 3). Others did
not coincide with changes in gyral geometry (e.g.,
border at position 49 in Figs. 2 and 3). Some of these
borders corresponded to those described by Sanides
and Vitzhum, e.g., the border at position 16 marked
subarea Rs and that at position 26 marked subarea Gb
(Sanides and Vitzhum, 1965a,b).
In area 18, zones with striking pyramidal cells
sometimes alternated with zones with relatively smaller
cells in layer III (Fig. 2). The laminar pattern in the
other layers remained unchanged. In Fig. 2 as in many
other sections, the subparcellations were related to
changes in the sizes of pyramidal cells in deep layer III:
In the region between positions 49 and 60, these cells
were especially prominent, whereas between positions
60 and 80 they were small. In some sections, a zone
with especially large pyramidal cells, i.e., giant cells,
was observed close to the border of areas 17 and 18. The
laminar pattern of this zone corresponded to that of
OB� as described by v.Economo and Koskinas (1925).
The border tuft (Gb) was located within this area. The
border of OB� within area 18 was sometimes difficult to
recognize since the size of the pyramidal cells decreased
gradually. OB� was not always present: in other sections, the pyramidal cells were not striking and did not
allow identification of the OB� either by visual inspection or quantitatively (e.g., Fig. 2). If present in the
histological section, the border of OB� was defined
quantitatively (v Economo and Koskinas 1925)


-----

allowed the identification of areas 17 and 18 and their
distinction from neighboring areas. However, the complexity of cytoarchitectonic changes at the transition of
two cortical areas makes it necessary, even in such a
‘‘simple’’ case as between areas 17 and 18, to analyze
these borders quantitatively.
The individual brains and their cytoarchitectonic
areas were transformed into the standard format of the
reference brain (Figs. 5 and 6). This transformation
allowed us to compare areal positions, extents, and
sizes regardless of differences in absolute brain size.
Area 17 was always located ventrally and dorsally at
the bottom of the calcarine sulcus. Only at the most
rostral sections was area 17 located on the ventral limb
of the calcarine sulcus and not on the dorsal limb. In
these sections as in all other coronal sections, area 17
was flanked by area 18 in the dorsal and ventral
directions. The calcarine sulcus differed in shape and
the number of its segments between the hemispheres
(compare, e.g., case 10 with remaining cases in Fig. 6).
The location of the border between areas 17 and 18, and
between 18 and higher visual areas, was variable with
respect to the free surface of the cuneus (compare, e.g.,
case 10, right side, with 6, right side, and 4, left side).
Both areas were limited dorsorostrally by the parietoccipital sulcus. On the most rostral sections, areas 17
and 18 did not reach the free surface of the parietal lobe
and were located in the ventrocaudal bank of the
parietooccipital sulcus. The most caudal portion of the
occipital lobe was occupied by area 17 to a different
degree (Fig. 5). Thus, brains differed significantly with
respect to shape, size, and location as projected on the
surface of the brain.
The mean volumes of areas 17 and 18 did not differ
significantly between the hemispheres. For area 17, six
brains had a larger volume on the left than on the right
side. In area 18, five brains were larger on the left than
on the right (for both areas P � 0.05). These differences
were independent of gender. The volumes of left and
right areas 17 were significantly larger than the volumes of areas 18 (P � 0.05). The volume of area 17
(both sides together) was 23.3 cm[3] (SEM 1.1), that for
area 18 (both sides together) was 19.5 cm[3] (SEM 1.2).
These differences were independent of the side
(P � 0.05).
Table 2 gives an overview of the ranges of both areas
and of the centers of gravity in the stereotaxic space
(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988). Ranges and centers of
gravity were averaged over the whole sample. The
locations of centers of gravity for both areas differed
significantly between the hemispheres. The centers on
the right were located more laterally than those on the
left (two-way ANOVA: P � 0.01, df � 9, F � 42.8). The
centers of gravity on the left were located more caudally
than those on the right (two-way ANOVA: P � 0 01


17 and 18 was found in all 10 cases. It is interesting to
note that both occipital poles tended to point to the
right (Table 2, fourth column). Parts of left areas 17 and
18 were located to the right of the medial plane (i.e., the
AC-PC line). In brains 4, 5, 8, and 10 this was especially
apparent (Fig. 5).
Comparing areas 17 and 18, it was found that the
centers of gravity of area 18 were located more laterally
than those of area 17 (two-way ANOVA: P � 0.01,
_df �_ 9, F � 89.3). Area 17 extends to a more caudal
position than area 18 (two-way ANOVA: P � 0.01,
_df �_ 9, F � 29.3). Whereas the most ventral positions
of areas 17 and 18 were similar for left and right
hemispheres, the most dorsal positions of area 18 are
higher than those of area 17 (Table 2, 9th and 10th
columns). The centers of gravity in the z direction were
similar for both hemispheres.
The corresponding coordinates of the stereotaxic
atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (1988) are compared in
Table 3. The coordinates of Talairach/Tournoux fall
within the ranges of our sample but tend to underestimate the extent of both areas. This is especially true for
the sagittal extent of areas 17 and 18 on the right.
Probability maps were created for further analysis of
spatial variability. They contain information on the
probability of a given area being present at a given
position, i.e., in an individual voxel of the reference
system of the standard brain. Each voxel therefore
represents the number of brains that overlap at that
point and was color-coded to represent that number.
Probability maps are shown in the coronal, sagittal,
and horizontal planes (Fig. 7). Area 17 of all brains was
located mainly in the depth of the calcarine sulcus. In
the most occipital sections, it extended farther onto the
free surface. Area 17 was least variable in the bottom of
the sulcus. The rostral border of the probability map of
area 17 approached the corpus callosum of the standard brain. The probability maps of area 18 surrounded
those of area 17 dorsally and ventrally (notice the two
foci of high probability above and below the calcarine
sulcus in the sagittal and coronal sections).
Variability between the 10 brains was further quantified. The volume of each area was calculated as it
relates to the number of overlapping brains (Fig. 8).
The bar chart shows large volumes for small numbers
of overlapping brains and small volumes for regions of
high overlap. Area 17 had a higher degree of overlap
than area 18. The decrease in volume relative to the
number of brains was less steep in area 17 than in 18.
Comparing the 50% volumes with the mean volumes
further quantified this finding. Whereas the 50% volume of area 17 occupied about 72% of the mean volume
of the area, the 50% volume of area 18 occupied only
40% (Fig 9)

arrowheads mark the borders of area 18 at positions 22 and 80. White
arrowheads indicate borders within area 17 (at position 16) and
within area 18 (at positions 26, 49, 60, and 74), i.e., internal borders.
Each D[2] value was calculated for the distance between two neighboring blocks of profiles with a certain number of profiles in each. The
number of profiles defines the block size and ranges from 8 to 22.
Comparing the positions of internal borders with the cytoarchitecture, it seems that the border at position 16 marks the beginning of
the border tuft. The border at position 26 in Fig. 2C seems to mark
the ending of the fringe area. The borders at positions 49 and 60 do
not represent a documented cytoarchitectonic border, but they occur
regularly and are regardless of block size and cannot be interpreted
as a result of technical artifacts.

**DISCUSSION**

The cytoarchitecture of the visual cortex has been the
subject of intensive research for many decades (Brodmann, 1903, 1909; v.Economo and Koskinas, 1925;
Filimonoff, 1932; Zilles et al., 1986; Leuba and Garey,
1989; Zilles and Schleicher, 1993). The same applies to
the myeloarchitecture (Vogt and Vogt, 1919; Flechsig,
1927; Lungwitz, 1937; Sanides and Vitzhum, 1965a,b;
Zilles and Schleicher, 1993) and the connectivity of
these areas (Burkhalter and Bernardo, 1989; Clarke
and Miklossy, 1990; Clarke, 1993; v.Essen et al., 1993;
Stepniewska and Kaas, 1996). Pigmentoarchitecture
(Braak, 1977), cytochrome oxidase (Wong-Riley et al.,
1993; Clarke, 1994), and receptor architecture (Zilles
and Schleicher, 1993; Zilles and Clarke, 1997) have also
been examined. For an overview see Zilles and Clarke
(1997). Functional imaging studies have further enhanced our knowledge about the organization of the


able anatomical maps for the topographical interpretation of activation clusters. The decision of whether an
activation cluster is within or outside an architectonic
region can be solved only if the border of this region is
determined. It is well known that area 17 is located in
the depth of the calcarine sulcus, but the positions of its
borders on the mesial surfaces of the hemispheres and
on the occipital poles vary from case to case (Filimonoff,
1932; Stensaas et al., 1974). For area 18 and many
other cortical areas, no reliable landmarks indicate the
precise or approximate positions of borders.
The automatic detection of the border between areas
17 and 18 was a good proof of the reliability of the
automated approach for border definition since it is one
of only a few cortical borders which can readily be
recognized in histological sections (Schleicher et al.,
1999). A comparably obvious border separates the
primary motor and the somatosensory cortex, i.e.,
Brodmann’s areas 4 and 3. A distinguishing feature of
area 17 is the structure of layer IV which becomes
abruptly altered at the border to 18. The change in
layer IV was therefore chosen for defining the border
between areas 17 and 18 (v.Economo and Koskinas,
1925). In this sense, the border between both areas is
clear.
This is, however, not the only architectonic change at
the transition between the two areas (Filimonoff, 1932).
Two myeloarchitectonic subareas (Rs, Gb) have been
identified; one belongs to area 17, the other to area 18
(Lungwitz, 1937; Sanides and Vitzhum, 1965a,b). These
subareas appeared in our myelin-stained sections and
were also detected in the sections stained for cell
bodies. In the latter, they were identified as significant
peaks in the distance function. Quantitative analysis of
the cytoarchitecture revealed further subdivisions
within areas 17 and 18. Subtle changes in the laminar
patterns were seen in the microscope, but they were
difficult to follow in larger series. Their description was
further complicated by the geometry of the gyri. Occipital gyri are relatively small and architectonic borders
are often located in curved regions, not at the plane
surface of the brain or of a gyrus (e.g., Fig. 2). In our
sample, at least in some sections, subparcellations of
area 18 were associated with the presence or absence of
large pyramidal cells in deep layer III. One of the first
studies to mention such inhomogeneities within area
18 (OB) was that of v.Economo and Koskinas (1925)


(v.Economo and Koskinas, 1925). This part of area OB, which is characterized by especially large pyramidal cells in layer III, is, however, in
this, as in some other sections, not clearly visible. (C) The digitized image with a cortical region containing larger parts of areas 17 and 18. The
gray value of each pixel in this image indicates the volume fraction of cell bodies, which is a good estimate of cell packing density: a high GLI is
represented by a dark pixel, a low GLI by a brighter pixel. The cortex is covered with vertical lines (‘‘traverses’’) running from the border
between layers I and II to the cortex/white matter border. Along each line, a GLI profile was measured. The positions of the profiles were
numbered (in this case, from 1 to 96) with equidistant intervals of approximately 128 µm. (D) Location of the GLI image (C) in the hemisphere.

who described subarea OB�. We found this subarea in
several sections and verified it quantitatively (see also
Schleicher et al., 1999). Our findings are in good
agreement with earlier studies which reported that
this subarea is not present in all sections (Vogt, 1929;
Filimonoff 1932) VEconomo and Koskinas noticed


scattered conglomerates of granule cell (OB�), but
their description did not allow us to identify these
subareas reliably.
A better understanding of cytoarchitectonic inhomogeneities in human areas 17 and 18 may come from
studies analyzing the connectivity of the visual cortex

and in the macaque. ‘‘Callosal-rich’’ and ‘‘callosal-poor’’
regions have been described in human area 18 (Clarke
and Miklossy, 1990; Clarke, 1993). Tracing studies
have shown that there are inhomogeneities in the
connection patterns within both areas (Burkhalter and
Bernardo, 1989; Merigan et al., 1993; Lewis and Olavarria, 1995; Gattass et al., 1997). Others have found
subparcellations in the patterns of cytochrome oxidase
staining in macaque as well as in human brains (DeYoe
and v.Essen, 1985; Livingstone and Hubel, 1987; Krubitzer and Kaas, 1990; Hockfield et al., 1990; Peterhans
and von der Heydt, 1993; Wong-Riley et al., 1993;
Nakamura et al., 1993; Tootell et al., 1993; Clarke,
1994; Roe and Tso, 1995; Tootell and Taylor, 1995b;
Olavarria and v.Essen, 1997; Elston and Rosa, 1998).
Considering these data, the final interpretation of
intraareal subparcellations would exceed the scope of
this cytoarchitectonic study. Therefore, only whole areas 17 and 18 were processed further (3-D reconstruction, transformation to the format of the standard
reference brain, and analysis of areas with respect to
location and extent).
The areal comparison of mean volumes showed that
area 17 was significantly larger than area 18. In the
past, volumetric measurements in human brains have
been carried out mainly for area 17 (these fit well with
our data) and not for 18 (Gerhardt and Kreht, 1933;
Rose, 1935; Stephan, 1969; Sauer et al., 1983; Frahm et
_al., 1984). Therefore, no comparison was carried out_
between volumes of areas 17 and 18. A study on the
visual cortex of the marmoset monkey (Rosa et al.,
1997) reported a considerably smaller total surface
area of V2 (corresponding roughly to area 18) than of
V1 (corresponding to area 17), which is in accordance
with data obtained in other animals (Krubitzer and
Kaas, 1990; Pessoa et al., 1992). Filimonoff has analyzed both areas in 13 hemispheres of human brains,
but he measured surface areas, not volumes. He found
a higher proportional size of area 18 than that of area
17 in man (Filimonoff, 1932), but area 17 was relatively
larger than area 18 in orangutan and in monkey (Filimonoff, 1933). The composition of his sample, however, was
far from optimal—only one female brain was included.
More recent studies showed sex differences in volumes
(Steinmetz et al., 1995; Amunts et al., 1999a).
Our own analysis of 10 postmortem brains also
revealed a considerable intersubject and interhemispheric variability both in the relation of cytoarchitectonic borders to surrounding sulci and gyri and in the

presence and shape of these landmarks. Filimonoff was
one of the first to analyze variability in sulcal patterns
quantitatively by calculating coefficients of variation
(26 and 25 for areas 17 and 18) on the basis of the
surfaces of 17 and 18 (Filimonoff, 1932). Several other
studies also have emphasized the variability of this
region (Brindley, 1972; Stensaas et al., 1974; v.Essen et
_al., 1984, 1998; Clark et al., 1996; Dumoulin et al.,_
1998; Kennedy et al., 1998; Thompson et al., 1998). We
have found that the size of area 17 on the exposed
surface of the cuneus as well as on the medial and
lateral surfaces of the brain was highly variable. This
was also true for the calcarine sulcus (Steinmetz et al.,
1989; Thompson et al., 1998). Variability can be interpreted as variability into the kind that is not predictable from visual landmarks and the kind that can be
related to the sulcal pattern (Rademacher et al., 1993).
The variable positions of area 17 on the free surface of
the occipital pole and its border to area 18 along the
extracalcarine cuneal and lingual planes belong to the
first kind. As we have shown in Figs. 5 and 6, there was
a large variability in the sulcal pattern. This concerned
the shape and continuity of the larger sulci (calcarine,
parietooccipital sulcus) and the presence and shape of
smaller sulci (Ono et al., 1990; Duvernoy, 1991). In
addition to intersubject differences, there were differences between the two hemispheres of one and the
same individual in the sulcal pattern and in the
relation of areas 17 and 18 to these sulci.
Interhemispheric differences were subjected to further analysis with respect to size and location of both
areas. The volumes of both areas did not differ significantly between the hemispheres. Similar findings for
area 17 were reported elsewhere (Rademacher et al.,

**TABLE 3**

18 Left/right 37 3 — �100 �60 — �16 28 —

_Note. Values for sagittal sections are given for both the left and the_
right hemispheres


1993). Interhemispheric differences, however, were
found in the positions of the areas. Both were located
more medially and caudally on the left than on the
right. This asymmetry in location of the areas in the
postmortem brains mainly reflects a topographical
asymmetry of the living human brain. Putative methodological factors (e.g., histological procedure, alignment
of brains) which may influence left–right differences in
shape obviously play only a minor role. First, in order to
minimize the deformation of the brains during histological procedure, their fixation was performed by hanging
them up on their vertebral arteries. This is preferable
to a fixation of brains which are lying on the bottom of
the fixation container and then, due to their own
weight, shift to one or the other hemisphere. Although
the brains therefore nearly ‘‘swim’’ in the fixative, there
is a residual deformation of the occipital poles; i.e., the
occipital poles of the fixed brains are pointing outward
more than in a brain in situ. Thus, compared with
stereotaxic data from living human brains (Grady et
_al., 1996; Hasnain et al., 1998; Goebel et al., 1998), the x_
coordinates (�mediolateral coordinates) of the centers
of gravity of both areas were shifted to a more lateral
position in our sample. The y and z coordinates of areas
17 and 18 of the postmortem brains coincide well with
those obtained in functional studies of living human
brains. However, deformation caused by fixation concerns primarily both occipital poles and therefore does
not act on asymmetry. Second, the alignment of the
postmortem brains to the standard reference brain
cannot introduce ‘‘artificial’’ left–right differences because only linear tools, which transform both hemispheres in the same manner, were applied (nonlinear
transformation tools were applied only for matching
the 3-D reconstructions to the MR sequences). These
linear tools reduced intersubject variability in the
location and extent of the cytoarchitectonic areas by
reducing variability in brain size and position of the
postmortem brains. The application of nonlinear fluid
transformation would further reduce the variability in
brain shape and size, which is influenced, e.g., by sex
and handedness, but would not keep left–right differences of the individual postmortem brain Thus it

removes nonlinear distortion caused by histology, but
introduces an asymmetry in shape of the postmortem
brain which is determined by the asymmetry of the
target brain, i.e., the reference brain (Roland and
Zilles, 1994; Zilles et al., 1997; Schormann and Zilles,
1998). Since one of the aims was the analysis of
topographical asymmetry, we refrained from applying
nonlinear transformation tools for the alignment of the
postmortem brains to the reference brain in this study.
Since methodological factors can explain asymmetry
only in stereotaxic locations of areas 17 and 18 to a
minor degree, it is essentially more important that
areas 17 and 18 form a large part of the occipital lobes
for which asymmetry has been reported in several
observations (LeMay and Kido, 1978; Falk et al., 1991).
An MRI analysis of petalia showed especially pronounced petalia in the occipital lobe and on the left side
(Zilles et al., 1996). Most of the lateral and medial
surfaces of the occipital lobes were protruded more
laterally and medially in the left hemisphere than in
the right (Zilles et al., 1996). The medial protrusion
corresponds to the extent of the visual areas into the
right half of the stereotaxic space.
Left–right differences in the positions of areas 17 and
18 are relevant for the anatomical interpretation of
clusters of functional activation in imaging studies.
The location of these clusters is often attributed to

areas according to the stereotaxic atlas of Talairach
and Tournoux (1988), which is based on Brodmann’s
schematic drawing of one left hemisphere. This atlas
considers neither left–right nor individual peculiarities, which is especially unfortunate in the case of the
occipital lobe where interhemispheric differences in the
shape are pronounced. The coordinates for right areas
17 and 18 are grossly underestimated in the Talairach/
Tournoux atlas. The remaining coordiantes of this atlas
fall within the range of those in our sample, but also
tend to underestimate. Functionally defined visual
areas also tend to have their centers of mass outside the
coordinates given by the Talairach atlas (Hasnain et al.,
1998). This is not surprising, since the location of both
areas in a single hemisphere cannot adequately represent the range of intersubject and interhemispheric
variability.
The variability in the topography of areas 17 and 18
of our study as estimated by SD coincides with the
variability of functional areas V1 and V2. As shown
recently in a PET study, the standard deviation was 5
mm across eight visual areas tested (Hasnain et al.,
1998). A fMRI study analyzing perception of faces found
an even higher degree of interindividual variability in
the topography of foci than we had found (Clark et al.,
1996). SD were 0.7–1.8 cm in the functional study and
0.2–0.7 cm in the present sample.
The importance of sulcal variability as related to
variability in size and position will be evaluated when


**FIG. 7.** Probability maps of areas 17 and 18 in the coronal, sagittal, and horizontal planes. The probability maps are shown in the format of

number of overlapping brains for each voxel is color coded; e.g., yellow means that 7 of 10 brains overlapped in this voxel. Coordinates of the

linear, affine ones) for aligning brains has been perfected (Miller et al., 1990; Christensen et al., 1994;
Schormann et al., 1996; Drury et al., 1997; Schormann
and Zilles, 1998, 1999). This approach can also answer
the question whether and to what extent the shape of
postmortem brains and of their areas differs from that
of living human brains and their functionally defined
areas. First results of nonlinear fluid transformations
of both areas were used for further analysis of their
intersubject variability; they were presented recently
(Amunts et al., 1999b).
Summarizing, this study was designed as a basis for
an analysis of structural–functional relationships in
the human visual system. Such an analysis requires
cortical maps with detailed and precise information on
the position and extent of cortical areas. Cortical maps
should therefore contain spatial and probabilistic information on the position and extent of cortical areas, i.e.,
the consideration of the individual variability, and they
should be based on mapping techniques which allow
the delineation of cytoarchitectonic areas by using
statistical tools of analysis. Our probability maps of
areas 17 and 18 fulfill these criteria: they are based on
10 brains in which the borders of each cytoarchitectonic
area were determined by an observer-independent procedure. The information was transferred to the stereotaxic space of the human brain atlas (Roland and Zilles,
1994, 1996). In contrast to the classical anatomical
maps which usually contain surface-based information
of cytoarchitectonic areas, these data on the location
and extent of both areas are in three-dimensional
space. Cortical maps of areas 17 and 18 have already
been applied in PET studies on the horizontal and
vertical meridians (Larsson et al., 1998), on figure–
ground segregation in the extrastriate cortex (Larsson
_et al., 1997), and on processing of color information_
(Gulyas et al., 1997). Probability maps of areas 17 and
18 are part of the European Computerized Human
Brain Database.
