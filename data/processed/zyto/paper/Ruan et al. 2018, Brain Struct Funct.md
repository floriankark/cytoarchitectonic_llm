**Abstract**
The dorsal mesial frontal cortex contains the supplementary motor area (SMA) and the pre-supplementary motor area (preSMA), which play an important role in action and cognition. Evidence from cytoarchitectonic, stimulation, and functional
studies suggests structural and functional divergence between the two subregions. However, a microstructural map of these
areas obtained in a representative sample of brains in a stereotaxic reference space is still lacking. In the present study we
show that the dorsal mesial frontal motor cortex comprises two microstructurally different brain regions: area SMA and area
pre-SMA. Area-specific cytoarchitectonic patterns were studied in serial histological sections stained for cell bodies of ten
human postmortem brains. Borders of the two cortical areas were identified using image analysis and statistical features. The
3D reconstructed areas were transferred to a common reference space, and probabilistic maps were calculated by superimposing the individual maps. A coordinate-based meta-analysis of functional imaging data was subsequently performed using
the two probabilistic maps as microstructurally defined seed regions. It revealed that areas SMA and pre-SMA were strongly
co-activated with areas in precentral, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri, Rolandic operculum, thalamus, putamen and
cerebellum. Both areas were related to motor functions, but area pre-SMA was involved in more complex processes such as
learning, cognitive processes and perception. The here described subsequent analyses led to converging evidence supporting
the microstructural, and functional segregation of areas SMA and pre-SMA, and maps will be made available to the scientific
community to further elucidate the microstructural substrates of motor and cognitive control.

### Introduction

The human mesial frontal motor area has for a long time
been thought of as being one entity. Campbell (1905) identified an intermediate precentral field, rostrally adjacent to
the primary motor cortex based on cyto- and myeloarchitectonic criteria. These observations were later confirmed
by Brodmann, who recognized a comparable region as the
mesial part of his area 6 (Brodmann area, BA6; Brodmann
1909). Vogt and Vogt (1910) published the first detailed
myeloarchitectonic map of the human frontal cortex, of
which areas 36–41 were comparable to Brodmann’s area 6
(Vogt 1910). In 1925, von Economo and Koskinas identified their mesial frontal motor area FB, and described verbally and pictorially the variations in cellular structure of
cerebral cortical layers (von Economo and Koskinas 1925;
Triarhou 2007). Braak (1980) recognized a similar area
as his superofrontal magnopyramidal region (sfm) (Braak
1980) (Fig. 1). Later cytoarchitectonic and functional neuroimaging studies identified the supplementary motor area
(SMA or SMA proper) and the pre-supplementary motor
area (pre-SMA) in the dorsal mesial frontal motor region
based on cytoarchitecture and receptor autoradiography
(Zilles et al. 1995; Picard and Strick 1996). It has to be
emphasized, however, that these maps differ regarding the
number of subareas identified, as well as the relative size
and extent of the areas SMA and pre-SMA.
The question if and how the mesial frontal cortex in the
superior frontal gyrus is parcellated into functional units
or modules has been a matter of interest in the past decades (Seitz et al. 2006). Importantly, it has been reported
that areas SMA and pre-SMA can be defined by means of
diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and subsequent probabilistic tractography. In this approach areas were defined
based on the assumption that similar connectivity profiles could be found within a region (Johansen-Berg et al.
2004; Klein et al. 2007). More recent hypotheses emphasize parcellations based on functional connectivity, e.g., a
definition of the putative areas SMA and pre-SMA using
resting state fMRI (Kim et al. 2010; Joliot et al. 2015).
Another approach identified areas SMA and pre-SMA in a
data-driven fashion based on their individual co-activation
patterns (Eickhoff et al. 2011). These clustering solutions
of the mesial frontal cortex are biologically meaningful
considering that the region of interest may show a multilayered functional hierarchy (Geyer and Turner 2015).
Areas SMA and pre-SMA are involved in a variety of
functions related with motor sequence processing, planning and executing (Hoshi and Tanji 2004; Cona et al.
2016; Hupfeld et al. 2016), as well as temporal and spatial processing of movements (Mita et al. 2009; Kotz and
Schwartze 2011). Furthermore, pre-SMA and SMA also

## 1 3


contribute to motor learning, speech and language processing (Seitz et al. 2006; Kim and Shin 2014; Hertrich
et al. 2016). Interestingly, pre-SMA and SMA also mediate motor inhibition (Toma et al. 1999; Li et al. 2006).
But important functional differences have been identified
between these two areas. For example, the selection of an
intended action, and the expected reward thereof have been
reported to modulate neural activity in the SMA (Elliott et al. 2003; Lee 2004). Conversely, the pre-SMA has
been considered as a motor control area guiding movement selection and scaling (Nachev et al. 2008; Ogawa
et al. 2006) and been implicated even in non-motor functions such as empathy (Seitz et al. 2008). Furthermore, the
pre-SMA is considered the most likely generator of the
so-called Bereitschaftspotential, which occurs as early as
1000 ms before movement onset (Kornhuber and Deecke
1965; Lau and Passingham 2007; Iacoboni et al. 2005). It
is, therefore, reasonable to expect that these two areas can
be differentiated in terms of microanatomy and functional
connectivity patterns.
The aim of the present study was to explore the cytoarchitectonical and functional dichotomy of areas SMA and
pre-SMA. For that purpose, we applied a novel approach for
anatomical and functional characterization of human brain
areas. It should be noted that the cytoarchitectonic and receptor autoradiography maps in the work by Zilles et al. (1995)
determined by observer dependent descriptions, were available only as two-dimensional schematic drawings and did not
include inter-individual variability of different brains. Therefore, the data could not be matched with functional imaging
data. In this study we attempted to overcome these limitations.
We acquired 3D datasets, as we first analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the human mesial frontal motor area in serial histological sections of ten human postmortem brains and used a
statistical approach for the observer-independent detection of
borders between cortical areas (Schleicher et al. 2005, 2009).
Second, the resulting individual maps of areas SMA and preSMA were then transferred to a common stereotaxic reference space to calculate continuous probabilistic maps, which
quantify inter-subject variability in the localization and extent
of areas SMA and pre-SMA, and maximum probability maps.
Third, these maximum probability maps of areas SMA and
pre-SMA served as seed volumes of interest for a coordinatebased meta-analysis to investigate the functional co-activation
patterns of each area.

angle 40°, reception time = 40 ms, time echo = 5 ms). Then,
the whole brains were embedded in paraffin and serially cut
in the coronal (n = 9) or horizontal plane (n = 1, case 17) on a
large-scale microtome (Polycut E, Reichert-Jung, Germany;
thickness = 20 µm). Each 15th section was mounted on a
glass slide and stained for cell bodies using modified silver
staining (Merker 1983).

#### Observer‑independent detection of cytoarchitectonic borders

An observer-independent mapping approach (Schleicher
et al. 2005) was used to identify cortical borders. This
approach was built on the assumption that the laminar pattern is similar within a cytoarchitectonic area, but varies
abruptly at the border between two adjacent areas. In practice, rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) were obtained
with a high-resolution CCD-Camera (Axiocam MRM,
ZEISS, Germany), which worked with an optical light
microscope (Axio Observer Z1, ZEISS, Germany). ROIs
were digitized with an in-plane resolution of 1.02 µm per
pixel and transformed into grey-level index (GLI) images
with in-house software written in MatLab (The MathWorks,
Inc., Natick, MA, USA). These GLI images provide quantitative information about the volume fraction of cell bodies
(Wree et al. 1982). For computation, the ROI was subdivided
into measuring fields (17 × 17 pixels in size) by a grid, cell
bodies were identified and segmented by adaptive thresholding, and all pixels in a measuring field which were labeled
as cells were transferred to an 8 bit grey value which coded
the volume fraction of stained cell bodies in that measuring
field (Schleicher et al. 2005).
Equidistant GLI profiles were extracted between the
outer contour line (the border between layers I and II) to
the inner contour line (the border between layer VI and the

## 1 3


white matter), which were manually traced on each highresolution scanned image. A set of ten features (including
the mean GLI value, the center of gravity in the axis of the
cortical depth, the standard deviation, the skewness, the kurtosis, and the analogous parameters for the first derivative of
each profile) was extracted from each GLI profile and used
to quantify the laminar pattern of the cortical ribbon at that
position (Schleicher et al. 2000, 2009).
The Mahalanobis distance D[2] (Mahalanobis et al. 1949)
was used to quantify differences between the feature vectors
of adjacent groups of profiles (Schleicher et al. 2005). To
decrease the noise during the calculation of the Mahalanobis
distance, a specified number of profiles (ranging from 10 to
30 profiles) were grouped into a block of profiles and the
_D[2] between adjacent blocks was computed. This procedure_
was repeated along the entire portion of the cortical ribbon
covered by the ROI by means of a sliding window procedure shifting the blocks of profiles by one profile each time
(Schleicher et al. 2000). The larger the difference between
profiles of adjacent blocks, the larger the ensuing D[2]. A subsequent Hotelling’s t2 test with Bonferroni correction was
selected to test for significant differences in D[2] values, and
the threshold was set at а = 0.001. Statistically significant
maxima in the Mahalanobis plot were interpreted as indicating cortical borders. Borders between cytoarchitectonic
areas were detected at positions with significant differences
in laminar patterns at a minimum of [two] different block
sizes and comparable positions in a minimum of three adjacent brain sections (Schleicher et al. 1999) (Fig. 2).

#### Interareal differences in cytoarchitectonic profiles

To quantitatively detect the cortical layer(s) responsible for
the cytoarchitectonic differences between areas SMA and
pre-SMA, the mean GLI profiles of each area were divided
into ten bins with a 10%-interval: bin 1 (0–10%), bin 2
(10–20%), …, bin 10 (90–100%). The mean GLI profile of
each area in each brain was calculated from six samples
(three samples per hemisphere and brain). In each sample,
representative blocks of 15 GLI profiles were extracted,
and mean GLI profiles produced. The mean GLI profiles
of area SMA were then compared with those of area preSMA using pairwise permutation comparisons (p < 0.05).
To avoid interferences caused by tangential sectioning, ROIs
were collected at sites, where the cortex appeared to be cut
perpendicular to the surface.

#### Volumetric analysis

The percentage of area volume and the total brain volume
were calculated to enable comparison of differently sized
brains and to analyze individual variability in the size of
SMA and pre-SMA. Furthermore, a shrinkage factor was


-----

defined for each postmortem brain as the ratio between the
fresh volume and the histological volume to compensate for
shrinkage during the histological processing (Amunts et al.
2007). We tested for differences of the volume proportion
under the aspect of hemisphere and gender differences with
a pairwise permutation test using in-house software written
in Matlab (p < 0.05, false discovery rate corrected for multiple comparisons) (Bludau et al. 2014). The null distribution
was evaluated by Monte Carlo simulation with a repetition
of 1,000,000 iterations. Subsequently, correlation between
volume and age was analyzed by computing the Spearman’s
rank correlation coefficient (p < 0.05).

#### Three‑D reconstruction and probabilistic maps

The borders of areas SMA and pre-SMA were interactively
transferred to high-resolution digitized images of the histological sections (1200 dpi; ~ 20 µm/pixel; 8 bit grey value
resolution). Then, the mapped areas were three-dimensionally (3D) reconstructed using the MR image sets of the ten
corresponding postmortem brains. The individual brains
and the delineations of the cortical areas were spatially normalized to the T1-weighted single-subject template of the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (Evans et al. 1992,
2012) reference brain with linear and non-linear transformation tools (Henn et al. 1997; Hömke 2006). Having all
brains and delineations in the same reference space allowed
us to calculate continuous probabilistic maps for each area in
MNI space. The probabilistic map of a given area represents
for each voxel of this particular area how many individuals
showed the respective cytoarchitectonic area in that voxel.
Thus, these maps quantitatively describe the inter-subject
variability of a cortical area in stereotaxic space.
Subsequently, a maximum probability map (MPM) of the
individual probabilistic maps were produced (Eickhoff et al.
2005, 2006). Within the MPM, each voxel was assigned to
the cytoarchitectonic area with the most likely anatomical
probability at that position. These MPMs of areas SMA and
pre-SMA were used to define the volumes of interest in the
coordinate-based meta-analysis.

#### Meta‑analytic connectivity modeling

To explore the area-specific functionality of SMA and preSMA, a coordinate-based meta-analysis was performed
on the co-activation maps of the two selected seed regions
in task-based activation data (Eickhoff et al. 2010). This
meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) employed
the revised activation likelihood estimation (ALE) tech[nique applied to the BrainMap database (http://brain​map.](http://brainmap.org/)
[org/) (Laird et al. 2005, 2011). The main principle of the](http://brainmap.org/)
ALE method is to treat the reported foci as centers for 3D
Gaussian probability distributions to capture the spatial


uncertainty related with each focus. All reported foci within
a 5 mm radius of the seed regions were identified (Eickhoff et al. 2011). This is a moderate compromise to reduce
image noise over false negatives. To recognize random and
non-random foci of convergence, the obtained ALE values
were compared with a null distribution reflecting a random
spatial correlation between the considered experiments with
familywise error (FWE) corrected p threshold of p < 0.05
(Eickhoff et al. 2012).
The seed regions were defined by the former created
MPMs of areas SMA and pre-SMA. Only those experiments
were included, that reported stereotaxic coordinates from
normal individual mapping studies in healthy humans using
fMRI or PET. Accordingly, 1398 functional imaging data
of pre-SMA (18,574 subjects, 21,552 foci) and 597 functional imaging data of SMA (7947 subjects, 9112 foci) were
included. The analysis set a threshold at a familywise error
(FWE) corrected cluster-level (p < 0.05).
To facilitate the functional interpretation of the co-activations patterns provided by the meta-analysis, the “Behavioral Domain” and “Paradigm Class” were categorized by
several hierarchically structured keywords as given in the
original articles present in the BrainMap database. “Behavioral Domain” classified the research in terms of the neural
systems studied according to six main categories and related
subcategories: cognition, action, perception, emotion, interoception, or pharmacology. “Paradigm Class” categorized
tasks in the jargon of the field, such as anti-saccades or mental rotation tasks (Laird et al. 2009). Note, that the categories
did not involve a post-hoc catergorization of the motor tasks
in the original studies nor of limb versus eye movements or
speech production.

### Results

#### Identification of areas SMA and pre‑SMA

Two agranular areas, SMA and pre-SMA, were identified on
the mesial surface of the hemisphere rostral to the primary
motor cortex. Area SMA abutted the primary motor cortex and was followed rostrally by pre-SMA. Area SMA was
characterized by a poor lamination, prominent large sized
pyramidal cells in the lower part of layer III (i.e., layer IIIc),
and the absence of Betz cells in layer V. Area pre-SMA differed essentially from area SMA by its dark layer V, which
was well demarcated from layers III and VI. In SMA the
boundary between layers III and V was not clearly visible.
Layer III pyramids were clearly smaller in pre-SMA than in
SMA (Table 2; Fig. 3). These differences in cytoarchitecture
were reflected by differences in the GLI profiles of each area,
with higher GLI values in the lower part of layer III of SMA
than in that of pre-SMA (Fig. 3), thus enabling identification

profiles of each of the areas were divided revealed significant
differences at the level of bin 4 and bin 5 (Fig. 5). The position of bins 4 and 5 coincided roughly with the location of
layer IIIc, i.e., the layer with prominent large pyramidal cells
in SMA, but less densely packed and with smaller pyramids
in pre-SMA (Fig. 3).
Areas SMA and pre-SMA were restricted to the medial
surface of the hemisphere in each brain. Although their dorsal borders were often found close to the dorsal convexity
of the hemisphere, they never encroached onto its lateral
surface (Supplementary Fig. 1). The ventral borders of areas
SMA and pre-SMA was found in the region of the cingulate
sulcus. For both areas, the border was found on the dorsal
bank of the sulcus, though that of pre-SMA was closer to
the free surface of the hemisphere. There were no gyri or
sulci reliably associated with the border between areas SMA
and pre-SMA (Supplementary Fig. 1). However, the border
between areas SMA and pre-SMA was closely associated
with the vertical plane through the anterior commissure, i.e.,
the VCA line.

#### Cytoarchitectonic borders with neighboring cortical areas

Areas SMA and pre-SMA were limited dorsally by the dorsal premotor cortex (PMd), i.e., by the portion of BA6 found
on the lateral surface of the superior frontal gyrus. SMA
mainly abuts the caudal part of PMd (PMdc), and pre-SMA
its rostral part (PMdr). Ventrally, areas SMA and pre-SMA
were followed by cingulate areas 24d and 24c, respectively
(Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2018). The caudal border of
SMA was with the primary motor cortex (BA4), and the
rostral border of pre-SMA was with prefrontal cortex (specifically with BA8). The transition between BA4 and area


SMA roughly coincided with the transition between cingulate areas 24d and BA23.

**SMA and BA4**

Both areas showed a poor lamination and a visible layer IV
was absent, i.e., they are agranular. BA4 was characterized
by the occurrence of giant pyramidal cells (Betz cells) in
layer Vb. Unlike BA4, SMA showed no giant pyramidal
cells in layer Vb, although some large pyramidal cells were
found in its caudal part. Most importantly, SMA showed an
increased cellular density in the lower part of layer III (Supplementary Fig. 2).

**SMA and PMdc**

Both areas were relatively poorly laminated, but had a conspicuous layer IIIc, which was denser and contained larger
pyramids in PMdc than in SMA. Furthermore, layer VI of
PMdc was more pronounced than that of SMA (Supplementary Fig. 3).

**SMA and 24d**

Both areas were agranular, but differed considerably in layers III and V. Area SMA, presented a prominent layer IIIc
with medium size pyramids, whereas in area 24d cells in the
lower part of layer III were considerably smaller. Moreover,
whereas layer V is inconspicuous in SMA, a dark layer V
with big or even giant pyramidal cells and well demarcated
layer VI were easily identified in area 24d (Supplementary
Fig. 4).

**Pre‑SMA and PMdr**

Both pre-SMA and PMdr presented a relatively prominent
layer V and a diffuse border between layers II and III. However, layer V neurons were larger and layer VI was more
demarcated in PMdr than that in pre-SMA (Supplementary
Fig. 5).

**Pre‑SMA and 24c**

Both areas were characterized by a clear lamination and a
relatively prominent layer V. However, layer V of 24c presented a higher packing density and larger cells than that of
pre-SMA. Furthermore, the border between layers V and VI
was sharper in 24c (Supplementary Fig. 6).

**Pre‑SMA and BA8**

The border between these two areas was clearly identifiable, because layer IV was not visible in cell-body-stained

sections of pre-SMA, while in BA8 this layer is clearly recognizable (Supplementary Fig. 7).

#### Volumetric analysis

The average total volume proportions of left and right SMA,
and left and right pre-SMA in relation to the whole brain
were 1.3%, 1.27%, 1.51%, and 1.47%, respectively. No
gender and hemispheric differences were found (Table 3).
The correlation test showed no interaction between age and
volume.

#### Three‑D probability maps and maximum probability maps

Probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of areas SMA and preSMA were computed in the anatomical MNI reference brain
(Amunts et al. 2005). The superimposition of all ten brains
showed that areas SMA and pre-SMA are located dorsal to
the cingulate sulcus in the mesial view. There was a relatively large inter-individual anatomical variability in the size
of the areas, as indicated by the fact that voxels coding for
a low overlap (blue and green tones) were more frequent
than voxels coding for a high overlap (red and orange tones)
(Fig. 6).
MPMs of areas SMA and pre-SMA were computed
(Fig. 7). This non-overlapping parcellation of areas SMA
and pre-SMA in a sample of ten human post mortem brains
reflected the most likely voxels of the areas. The caudal
boundary of area SMA was located anterior to the vertical plane through the posterior commissure (y = − 28);
the border between areas SMA and pre-SMA was closely

associated with the vertical plane through the anterior commissure (y = 0). The mean center of gravity of area SMA was
caudal to the anterior commissure and that of the pre-SMA
rostral to the anterior commissure in the anatomical MNI
space (Table 4).

#### Coordinate‑based meta‑analysis of functional imaging studies

The MPMs were used as seed regions for the MACM analysis using the BrainMap database. According to the coordinate-based meta-analysis of areas SMA and pre-SMA, 15
co-activation clusters for area SMA and 12 co-activation
clusters for area pre-SMA were found in cortical and subcortical locations (Table 5). MACM analysis showed that both
area SMA and pre-SMA were strongly co-activated with the
precentral, supramarginal and superior frontal gyri, Rolandic
operculum, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. The contrast

analysis of co-activation clusters between areas SMA and
pre-SMA showed that the two areas have functionally dissociating connections. Area SMA was significantly more
strongly co-activated with the precentral and supramarginal
gyrus and caudal dorsal premotor cortex. Area pre-SMA,


however, was significantly more strongly co-activated with
the inferior parietal lobule, posterior parietal cortices and
rostral dorsal premotor cortex (Fig. 8).
Functional characterization according to the BrainMap
meta-data was performed for area SMA and pre-SMA. We
found areas SMA and pre-SMA to share some common
behavioral domains (action execution and action imagination) and some paradigms (drawing, flexion/extension, imagined movement, and finger tapping/button press). Apart from
that, area SMA was significantly related with domains such
as interoception (and also more specifically with the domain
associated with the bladder), and somesthetic perception.
Area pre-SMA was correlated with domains such as action
(motor learning, execution speech), cognition (in particular
with the specific music domain), and the visual perception
of motion. Moreover, the area pre-SMA was associated with
tasks like sequence recall/learning, saccades and music comprehension. The contrast analysis of behavioral domains
revealed that area SMA was more associated with action
execution than area pre-SMA (Fig. 9). These results demonstrated that both areas SMA and pre-SMA were related to
motor functions, but area pre-SMA was related to multiple
functions beyond motor control such as perception, learning
and cognitive perception.

### Discussion

In the present study, we applied a novel approach for 3D
quantitative and statistically testable mapping to identify
and differentiate areas SMA (SMA proper) and pre-SMA on
the mesial surface of the hemisphere rostral to the primary
motor cortex. Specifically, in stereotactic space the pre-SMA
was localized rostral and the SMA caudal to the vertical
plane through the anterior commissure. Furthermore, the different cytoarchitectonic patterns of the two areas were used
to investigate if the two regions were part of different functional networks within the brain as evident from functional
brain imaging. For that purpose, a meta-analysis of resting
state functional imaging data was performed to demonstrate
differential connectivity patterns. Furthermore, a meta-analysis of functional activation data classified according to different behavioural categories was employed to explore to
what extent areas SMA and pre-SMA belonged to different
functional networks. The combined findings were expected
to provide evidence for a functional differentiation of human
areas SMA and pre-SMA from the microscopical cytoarchitectonic to the macroscopical functional imaging level.

#### Cytoarchitecture of areas SMA and pre‑SMA

Agranular area SMA was characterized by a poor lamination, and densely packed large size pyramidal cells in the
lower part of layer III. Agranular area pre-SMA presented a
more differentiated laminar pattern and a more pronounced
layer V. These findings are in accordance with previous
cytoarchitectonic studies (Zilles et al. 1995, 1996; Vorobiev
et al. 1998). We were not able, however, to confirm Vorobiev’s (1998) subdivision of SMA proper into two parts:
SMA caudal and SMA rostral—no significant borders were
detected within SMA. The photomicrographs of SMA caudal in Vorobiev’s study might depict the transition between
the rostral portion of BA4 and the caudal portion of his area
6 (SMA proper), since they showed large pyramidal cells in
layer V with the size which was between that of Betz cells
and large sized cells of layer V in area SMA. Therefore, the

## 1 3


so-called caudal SMA may be the transition between BA4
and area SMA, and was not part of the present study.
Subsequent analysis of profiles based on their subdivision
into 10 bins allowed to identify differences between SMA
and pre-SMA at bins 4 and 5 (40%-50%), which roughly
corresponded to the position of lower layer III. This suggests
that the most prominent differences between areas SMA and
pre-SMA were differences of cell packing density in layer
IIIc.
Importantly, the cytoarchitectonic border between areas
SMA and pre-SMA was located close to the vertical plane
through the anterior commissure (Y = 0), which is in good
agreement with earlier cytoarchitectonic data provided by
Zilles et al. (1996) and in-vivo data as delineated by diffusion tractography (Johansen-Berg et al. 2004). Although an
inherent limitation exists in anatomical accuracy of brain
connections derived from diffusion tractography (Thomas
et al. 2014), this concordance between the two different
techniques performed on independent samples is noteworthy considering that this provides an approach to in-vivo
investigation of human brain organization, which shows a
good congruency with cytoarchitectonic mapping in postmortem samples.
Nevertheless, there was a notble difference between the
cytoarchitectonic analysis and the MACM analysis, as the
co-activation pattern lolacized the pre-SMA more anterior
than the cytoarchitectonically delineated pre-SMA. This
may result from the fact that the saccade task was related
to the SMA as derived from functional co-activation (Eickhoff et al. 2011), but related to the pre-SMA as derived
from cytoarchitecture analysis. Such a discrepancy may be
accounted for by the fact that cytoarchitecture reflects the
inner organization of cortical areas which is related but not
equal to the functional properties of these regions.

#### From architectonical to functional gradation

Based on earlier observations of Vogt (1919) and of Brockhaus (Brockhaus 1940), Sanides introduced the term “gradation” and “Gradationsprinzip” (gradation principle) to

in the cerebral cortex (Sanides 1962, 1964). In fact, our

structural magenetic resonance
imaging data by means of the

2012). According to the gradation principle, the mesial
frontal motor cortex originates from the posterior precentral cortex (Sanides 1962, 1964). In our study, we found a
gradation stream in the sense that the cell size in layer V
relatively increased when moving from caudal area SMA to
rostral area pre-SMA. Moreover, we found that from areas
SMA to pre-SMA, from areas 24d to 24c, from areas PMdc
to PMdr, they shared some common changes of cytoarchitectonic characterizations: The relative cell density in layer
II decreased; the relative cell density and cell size in layer
IIIc decreased; the cell density in layer V increased. These
findings in these areas are in accordance with the notion that
cortical areas do not simply form a mosaic, but are hierarchically organized (Amunts and Zilles 2012). Thus, our findings suggest that gradation streams not only exist between
large regions (e.g., from area 4 to area 6), but also between
subareas (e.g., from area SMA to area pre-SMA).

The architectonic gradation is likely to be accompanied
by a functional gradation across the areas. According to the
behavioral domain and paradigm class-based analysis, we
noted that area pre-SMA and area SMA are both involved
in sensorimotor integration for action generation. The more
posteriorly located primary motor cortex plays an important role in the execution of body movement (Hlustik et al.
2001; Schieber 2001). Interestingly, electric stimulation of
the primary motor cortex, of pre-SMA, SMA resulted in the
induction of movements, although it was more difficult to
do so from pre-SMA than from SMA than from the primary
motor cortex (Luppino et al. 1991). Moreover, our functional
meta-analysis revealed that area SMA was closely linked
to movement execution, while the pre-SMA was concerned
with higher movement control mechanisms such as in procedural learning and language production (Ikeda et al. 1999;
Seitz et al. 2006; Rochas et al. 2013). Thus, when moving from the primary motor cortex through SMA and into
pre-SMA, the areas’ involvement in movement execution
became more remote. This suggests that in the human brain
at least some functions are associated with subtle gradations
in parallel to the cytoarchitectonic gradation changes rather
than in a mosaic-like fashion.

#### Functional connectivity of areas SMA and pre‑SMA

The coordinate-based meta-analytic connectivity modeling analysis allowed us to identify the brain areas that

Cluster maxima assigned to the most probable cytoarchitectonic area when present in the SPM Anatomy
Toolbox (Eickhhoff et al. 2005)


constituted functional neural networks for areas SMA and
pre-SMA. We found that both of them accommodate extensive cortico-subcortical circuits involving the precentral
gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, superior frontal gyrus, Rolandic
operculum, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. However,
the anterior cluster corresponding to area pre-SMA derived
showed significantly higher co-activation probabilities with
inferior frontal and posterior parietal cortices. By contrast,
the posterior cluster was more strongly co-activated with
precentral gyrus, and caudal dorsal premotor cortex. Some
of these co-activations resulted from true anatomical connectivity. For example, areas SMA and pre-SMA project to
the putamen and cerebellum (Alexander et al. 1986; Akkal
et al. 2007). Likewise, SMA and pre-SMA are connected
with the precentral gyrus and with more anterior portions
of the superior frontal gyrus (Luppino et al. 1993). However, areas SMA and pre-SMA also were found to have


differential connections. For example, area SMA had a
strong association with the putamen, while area pre-SMA
was more strongly related to the caudate nucleus. This was
in accordance with the results of an earlier fibre tracking
study (Alexander et al. 1986). It must be emphasized, however, that functional connectivity does not imply a direct
anatomical connection between the respective brain regions
(Eickhoff and Grefkes 2011). For example, the co-activation
patterns between areas SMA, pre-SMA and the Rolandic
operculum are functional rather than reflecting direct anatomical connections among them.
Despite theis congruency, some differences were found
when anatomical were taken into consideration. In diffusion tensor imaging the area pre-SMA had dense anatomical
connections to the medial parietal cortex (Johansen-Berg
et al. 2004), which were not apparent in the present study.
Moreover, MACM showed that areas SMA and pre-SMA

had significant connections with the cerebellum, which were
not presented in diffusion tractography (Johansen-Berg et al.
2004). This may be explained by the different approaches
employed in the two studies. The anatomical connectivity
and the functional connectivity are conceptually different:
the former is a task-independent property, while the latter is
a task-dependent property (Eickhoff et al. 2011).

#### Comparison to resting state functional connectivity

The human mesial frontal cortex has also been parcellated
based on the similarity of functional connections using
resting state functional MRI (Kim et al. 2010). The vertical
plane through the anterior commissure, a reliable macroanatomical landmark associated with the cytoarchitectonically
identified border between areas SMA and pre-SMA (present
observations; Zilles et al. 1996), also constituted the border
between the anterior and posterior clusters derived from resting state functional MRI (Kim et al. 2010). It was reported
that the functional networks in “rest” showed a close correspondence with the functional networks in explicit “activation” (Smith et al. 2009; Simonyan and Fuertinger 2015).

#### Primate data on ares SMA and pre‑SMA

Areas SMA and pre-SMA were identified and differentiated
from each other also in non-human primates using cytoarchitectonic, connectivity and stimulation studies. Cytoarchitectonic studies revealed in the agranular mesial frontal cortex
two distinct areas one of which was labeled F3 corresponding to SMA and the other F6 corresponding to pre-SMA
(Matelli et al. 1991). Ventrally adjacent four distint areas in
the cingulate gyrus and on the lateral convexity a number of
subareas in premotor cortex were identified (Matelli et al.
1991). It was found that SMA is richly linked with motor
cortex, posterior premotor cortex and dorsal cingulate and
parietal cortical areas, while pre-SMA receives input from
the anterior premotor cortex, midfrontal cortex and midcingulate area 24c but has no connections to motor cortex (Luppino et al. 1993). In addition, SMA receives about half of the
callosal input from its counterpart in the other hemisphere,
whereas pre-SMA receives input preferentially from dorsal
and ventral premotor cortex, the cingulate motor area, and
prefrontal cortex (Liu et al. 2002). In addition, there are
strong projections from subcortical brain structures including the pallidum, thalamus, and the cerebellum via thalamus
to the SMA (Rouiller et al. 1994). Both areas have efferent
connections to subcortical loactions with segregated corticostriatal and corticosubthalamic input zones (Inase et al.
1999).
These anatomical differences appear to accommodate
functional differences among these two cortical areas, as
neuronal activity differed between SMA and pre-SMA in
relation to instruction and execution of movmements. For
example, in a visuomotor task neural activity in SMA was
related to use of the right or left arm, while activity in preSMA was related to location of the target (Hoshi and Tanji
2004). There is some indication of somatotopic organization of the SMA as evident from microstimulation mapping
(Mitz and Wise 1987; Luppino et al. 1991) which may be
related to strong corticospinal projections from the SMA
(Galea and Darian-Smith 1994). In contrast, microstimulation of the pre-SMA frequently resulted in slow forelimb
movements that were similar to natural movements (Luppino
et al. 1991). Furthermore, pre-SMA seems to code more
complex aspects of movement patterns as pre-movement
activity in pre-SMA was found to be selective to the second-next movement before initiation of the first movement
(Nakajima et al. 2009). Moreover, in sequential motor tasks
performed from memory neuronal activity in pre-SMA
resembled a binary-code which was uncommon in SMA
(Shima and Tanji 2006).

classes (bottom row) of the BrainMap meta-data


#### Functional distinction of mesial frontal cortex and neighboring areas

Adjacent to pre-SMA, but not SMA, there are a number of
neighboring areas referred to as anterior midcingulate cortex (aMCC), dorsomedial prefrontal cortex (dmPFC), and
PMd which also were characterized by multimodal mapping
similarly as in this study. The functionally defined region
within the aMCC (Hoffstaedter et al. 2014) showed largely
overlapping co-activation clusters in lateral premotor cortex, Rolandic operculum, putamen, inferior parietal lobule,
cerebellum and thalamus similarly to the present study but
not with the supramarginal gyrus, superior temporal gyrus,
superior parietal lobule and inferior occipital gyrus. In contrast, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and intraparietal
sulcus were more likely co-activated with that functionally
defined region within aMCC (Hoffstaedter et al. 2014) than
in our study. It is possible that the difference was due to the
role of aMCC in intentional movement initiation involving
pain and negative affect (Shackman et al. 2011; Hoffstaedter
et al. 2013; Tolomeo et al. 2016).


In addition, it was noted that mesial frontal cortex and
dmPFC showed overlapping functional connectivity with
inferior parietal cortex, inferior frontal gyrus and prefrontal cortex. However, the dmPFC was co-activated specifically with clusters involving emotion like amygdala and
hippocampus (Eickhoff et al. 2016). In contrast, the mesial
frontal cortex was more strongly co-activated with the precentral gyrus, supramarginal gyrus, lateral premotor cortex,
superior temporal gyrus, superior parietal lobule, putamen,
cerebellum and thalamus. Recently, the dmPFC was related
to emotion and social cognition (Schurz et al. 2014; Wagner
et al. 2016) which was not found in the functional coding
analysis of mesial frontal cortex in present study.
The laterally neighboring area of mesial frontal cortex,
PMd, which has been investigated using the same approach
as the present study was found to be co-activated with the
precentral gyrus, thalamus, putamen and cerebellum. However, regionally specific co-activation clusters suggested that
PMd was more likely to co-activate with dorsal prefrontal
cortex (Benjamin et al. 2016). In addition, the mesial frontal
cortex connected with cerebellum at lobule VI, while PMd

## 1 3

connected with dorsal surface of cerebellum (Benjamin et al.
2016). Both PMd and mesial frontal cortex were related to
action (execution and imagination) and interoception as well
as memory and movement sequence processing (PastorBernier et al. 2012; Solopchuk et al. 2016).

### Conclusions

In this anatomical and multimodal imaging approach based
on an observer-independent methods for identifying borders
of cortical areas, we were able to demonstrate that the dorsal mesial frontal cortex comprised of two structurally and
functionally heterogeneous areas: area SMA and pre-SMA
supporting and extending earlier observations in humans and
non-human primates (Picard and Strick 1996). The probabilistic maps of area SMA and pre-SMA in standard MNI
space are steps toward a complete map of the human cerebral
cortex based on an observer-independent quantitative and
statistically testable cytoarchitectonic parcellation approach.
Using the maximum probability maps of area SMA and preSMA as seed regions for a coordinate-based neuroimaging
meta-analysis, we were able to describe also a functional
segregation between areas SMA and pre-SMA. Although,
our results further support the notion that the integration of
different methodological approaches distinguishing cortical
modules is necessary to understand the link between brain
structure and function (Amunts and Zilles 2015), future
studies are needed to account for the diversity and integration of human brain function.
