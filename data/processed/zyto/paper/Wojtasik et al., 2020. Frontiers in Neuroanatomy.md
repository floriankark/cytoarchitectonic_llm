### A comprehensive concept of the biological basis of reward, social and emotional behavior, and language requires a deeper understanding of the microstructure and connectivity of the underlying brain regions. Such understanding could provide deeper insights into their role in functional networks, and form the anatomical basis of the functional segregation of this region as shown in recent in vivo imaging studies. Here, we investigated the cytoarchitecture of the lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) in serial histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains by image analysis and a statistically reproducible approach to detect borders between cortical areas. Profiles of the volume fraction of cell bodies were therefore extracted from digitized histological images, describing laminar changes from the layer I/layer II boundary to the white matter. As a result, four new areas, Fo4–7, were identified. Area Fo4 was mainly found in the anterior orbital gyrus (AOG), Fo5 anteriorly in the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG), Fo6 in the lateral orbital gyrus (LOG), and Fo7 in the lateral orbital sulcus. Areas differed in cortical thickness, abundance and size of pyramidal cells in layer III and degree of granularity in layer IV. A hierarchical cluster analysis was used to quantify cytoarchitectonic differences between them. The 3D-reconstructed areas were transformed into the single-subject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI), where probabilistic maps and a maximum probability map (MPM) were calculated as part of the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas. These maps served as reference data to study the functional properties of the areas using the BrainMap database. The type of behavioral tasks that activated them was analyzed to get first insights of co-activation patterns of the lateral OFC and its contribution to cognitive networks. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) showed that functional decoding revealed activation in gustatory perception

## INTRODUCTION

The lateral orbitofrontal cortex (lateral OFC) includes
the cytoarchitectonically defined Brodmann area (BA) 47
(Brodmann, 1909). It seems to occupy a structurally variable
part of the human brain (Chiavaras and Petrides, 2000).
According to Brodmann, BA 47 spans over the lateral orbital
gyrus (LOG) with extensions into the posterior parts of the
ventrolateral frontal cortex and anterior parts of the inferior
frontal gyrus (IFG; Brodmann, 1909). As known from previous
studies, the macroanatomy itself is variable with respect
to the sulcal and gyral patterns including interhemispheric
differences (Chiavaras and Petrides, 2000; Chiavaras et al.,
2001; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004; Rodrigues et al., 2015;
Rolls et al., 2015). In many cases, the OFC is composed
of an ‘‘H’’-shaped pattern of sulci, which is characterized
by the lateral and medial orbital sulcus (LOS, MOS). They
run parallel to each other, are separated by the anterior
orbital gyrus (AOG), and connected through the transverse
orbital sulcus (TOS). Other patterns have been described
as well (Ono et al., 1990; Chiavaras et al., 2001; Rodrigues
et al., 2015), but the relationship of the different sulcal
patterns with the microstructure at the level of areas are
not well understood.
Previous studies have shown that the lateral OFC could
be divided into a different number of areas. The parcellation
schemes became more complex and fine-grained over time (see
**Figure 1). Different approaches were applied to map the lateral**
OFC including histological techniques such as cytoarchitectonic
analysis or the function-driven approach using the functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) technique. The varying
number of areas, their size and location were influenced by the
different analysis techniques as well as intersubject variability in
brain shape and size.
In addition, different conceptual approaches were applied
to characterize the lateral OFC, and introduced, for example,
subareas and transitions. The term ‘‘area 47/12’’ was first
_postulated by Öngür and Price (2000). Further studies took_
up this term (Petrides and Pandya, 2002; Öngür et al., 2003;
Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004; Deng et al., 2017), and assigned
it to one large area surrounding the LOG. In combination
with the medial OFC, the designations 47 m for the medial
OFC and 47l for the lateral OFC were postulated (Uylings
et al., 2000, 2010). Further terms were introduced, which
reflected the topography, i.e., 47 m for the medial frontal
cortex and 47[◦] for the OFC (Neubert et al., 2015). Recently,
some areas in the medial OFC have been named after their


topographic location, abbreviated and numbered consecutively.
Research from our own group identified area Fo1 in the
anterior gyrus rectus, Fo2 in the posterior gyrus rectus, and area
Fo3 reaching from the inner medial orbital sulcus to the outer
medial orbital sulcus, enclosing Fo1 and Fo2 laterally (Henssen
et al., 2016). The analysis was based on cytoarchitecture, and
considered changes in cell density and cell distribution, mainly
in layers III, IV and V.
Functional analyses of the lateral OFC revealed that this
region is involved in the processing of gustatory, olfactory
or somatosensory rewarding stimuli but also the processing
of emotional punishments, evaluating and updating the
emotional status, maintaining social behavior, active retrieval of
information, semantic processing, verb generation, processing
of stimuli that have a coherent temporal structure, music
listening, assigning value to certain things and events and
decision-making (Papathanassiou et al., 2000; Levitin and
Menon, 2003; Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004; Petrides, 2005;
Campbell-Meiklejohn et al., 2012; Alluri et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2015; Neubert et al., 2015; Rolls et al., 2015; Hirose et al.,
2016). Tasks that require quick responses while retrieving
information from the long-term and working memory also
showed activations in the lateral OFC. This region seems
to create an interconnecting role between the frontal cortex
and the hippocampus (Ross et al., 2013; Deng et al., 2017;
Rudebeck and Rich, 2018). Another functional study separated
the OFC into a medial and a lateral portion (Zald et al.,
2014). The latter corresponded to BA 47 and co-activated
with areas in the IFG and area BA 46/9 of the dorsomedial
frontal cortex along with several subcortical structures,
e.g., the amygdala, hippocampus and nucleus accumbens
among others.
The present study provides a comprehensive
cytoarchitectonic analysis of the human lateral OFC using
a computerized approach to detect cytoarchitectonic borders
between adjacent areas based on image analysis and statistical
criteria (Schleicher et al., 1998, 1999, 2005), and provides
cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps in 3D reference space
(Amunts and Zilles, 2015). The maps have been created based
on the same methods as used for previous mapping studies
of our group [most recent include, e.g., the parietal cortex
(Richter et al., 2019), the motor cortex (Ruan et al., 2018),
and the fusiform gyrus (Lorenz et al., 2017)], and allow to
integrate them into a coherent atlas framework of the human
brain. Meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM) was
conducted to assess all task-based functional connectivities
between the lateral OFC areas and their respective co-activated


-----

cortical and subcortical brain regions in the same reference
space. Their corresponding activation foci with the lateral
OFC areas as seed regions were detected via the BrainMap
database (Laird et al., 2009; Robinson et al., 2010). The
present work aims to combine the structural peculiarity of the
lateral OFC with its functional properties and to give a first
insight into the cognitive networks in which the lateral OFC
is integrated.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Processing of Postmortem Brains
Ten brains (five females with age range of 59–86 years, and five
males with age range of 30–75 years, mean age of 65, 8 years) were
obtained from the body donor program of the Department of
Anatomy at the University Hospital Düsseldorf of the HeinrichHeine-University in accordance with legal requirements with
no indications of neurologic or psychiatric diseases in clinical
records. The postmortem delay did not exceed 24–36 h (Table 1).
The brains were fixed in 4% buffered formalin (pH 7.4) or
Bodian’s fixative for at least 6 months. All brains underwent
magnetic resonance imaging on a Siemens 1.5 Tesla scanner
(Erlangen, Germany) using a T1-weighted 3D FLASH sequence
(flip angle 40[◦], repetition time TR 40 ms, echo time TE 5 ms).


Obtained images were used as an undistorted spatial reference for
the 3D-reconstruction of the histological sections as previously
described (Bludau et al., 2014).
Brains were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned in the
coronal plane on a large-scale microtome (thickness of 20 µm).
Every 15th section (corresponding to a distance of 300 µm)
was mounted on a glass slide covered with gelatin, stained for

cell bodies using a silver staining technique (Merker, 1983),
and digitized on a flatbed scanner (resolution of 1,200 dpi). At
least every 60th section was analyzed (distance between them
of 1.200 µm).

## Identification of Cytoarchitectonic Borders Based on the Grey Level Index (GLI)
The identification of cytoarchitectonic borders (Supplementary
**Figure S1A) was based on image analyses of rectangular**
regions of interests (ROIs) in every 60th histological section,
and statistical criteria (Schleicher et al., 1998, 1999, 2005).
ROIs were digitized with a CCD camera (Axiocam MRm,
ZEISS, Germany), which was connected to a computercontrolled optical light microscope with motorized scanning
stage (Axioplan 2 imaging, ZEISS, Germany). The Zeiss image
analysis software Axiovision (version 4.6) allowed to scan
the defined ROIs in a mosaic-like way with an in-plane
resolution of 1.02 µm per pixel (Supplementary Figure S1B).
GLI images were computed in adjacent square fields of
17 × 17 µm using in-house written MatLab scripts (The
MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) as a robust estimate
of the volume fraction of cell bodies (Wree et al., 1982;
Schleicher et al., 1986, 2005; Supplementary Figure S1C). The
GLI is defined as an estimate of the local volume density
of cellular structures that is influenced by section thickness
(here 20 µm for all sections). The GLI measures the areal
proportion as a numerical equivalent for the volume density
(Schleicher et al., 1986). The GLI is the ratio of the area
covered by image elements, which are darker than a given
gray value threshold, to the entire area of the measuring
field, which is of fixed size (Schleicher et al., 1986). The gray
value threshold was set to the gray value of the boundary
between the dark cellular image elements and the bright
background by analyzing the gray value histogram of the image
(Schleicher et al., 1986). The cortical ribbon was delineated
by an outer contour (border between layer I and II) and an
inner contour line (border between layer VI and white matter;
**Supplementary Figure S1D). Curvilinear traverses running**
perpendicular to the cortical layers from the outer to the inner
contour were defined to calculate GLI profiles (Supplementary
**Figure S1E), and GLI values, reflecting the laminar changes**
in cytoarchitecture, were extracted along the traverses. GLI
profiles were described by a 10-element feature vector consisting
of the mean GLI value, the center of gravity in x- and ydirection, the standard deviation, kurtosis, skewness and the
equivalent parameters of the profiles’ first derivatives (Schleicher
et al., 2005). Vectors of each profile were used to calculate the
Mahalanobis distance (MD, Mahalanobis et al., 1949) between
blocks of profiles. The MD is a measure for cytoarchitectonic
dissimilarity between profiles. The larger the dissimilarity, the
higher the MD, and vice versa. A Hotelling’s T2 test with
Bonferroni correction was applied to test for significance
between differences of profiles. A predefined number of profiles
was combined into a block, with a block size ranging from
12 to 30 profiles to increase robustness of the procedure.
MDs were computed in a sliding window procedure for each
profile position and every block size surrounding this position


across the whole cortex in each ROI. If the MD reached a
significant maximum at different block sizes at a certain profile
position (Supplementary Figure S1F), a cytoarchitectonic
border was assumed (Supplementary Figures S1G,H). Resulting
areas were manually delineated in digitized high-resolution
scans via the Section Tracer Online Tool developed in-house
(Supplementary Figure S1I).

## Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of Cytoarchitectonic Dissimilarities Between Cortical Areas
A hierarchical cluster analysis was performed to detect structural
dissimilarities between the lateral OFC areas, and compared
to the adjacent areas Fo3 (Henssen et al., 2016), Fp1 (Bludau
et al., 2014) as well as area 45 as part of Broca’s region
(Amunts et al., 2004). Therefore, 15–20 consecutive profiles
were extracted in three successive sections per area and
hemisphere in each of the 10 brains at cortical locations
where curvature and tangency had their lowest expanse. Each
profile was represented by the 10-element feature vector,
which enabled the analysis of linkage (Ward’s method)
and distance (Euclidean distance) between given areas to
quantify their degree of dissimilarity. The Euclidean distance
describes the distances between pairs of neighboring profiles,
i.e., the differences in the shape of these profiles, without
taking into account the variability within clusters of profiles
(Schleicher et al., 1998, 1999). An in-house written script
for MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) was
used for the calculation. A value of a high Euclidean distance
indicated a low structural similarity (and a large degree
of cytoarchitectonic difference), and vice versa, a low value
indicated high similarity. Respective brains were pooled either
by gender (male/female) or by hemisphere (left/right). A
dendrogram visualized the hierarchical clustering of all analyzed
cortical areas.

## Probabilistic Cytoarchitectonic Maps in Stereotaxic Space and Maximum Probability Maps (MPMs)
The contour lines of the areas of the lateral OFC of all 10
brains were interactively traced onto 1,200 dpi high-resolution
images of the histological sections, and 3D-reconstructed
(Bludau et al., 2014). Spatially normalized areas of all 10
brains were transferred onto the T1-weighted, single-subject
brain template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
‘‘Colin27’’. This brain template was used as the anatomical
reference brain (Holmes et al., 1998; Evans et al., 2012) and
transferred to anatomical MNI space (Amunts et al., 2005).
After the superimposition of the areas in reference space,
probabilistic maps were calculated. They showed the percentage
of location and size probability of a given area in each voxel
in the reference brain, and were color-coded values from 10%
(blue) to 100% (red). Subsequently, a maximum probability
map (MPM) was calculated for the whole lateral OFC, where
each voxel was assigned to the cytoarchitectonic area with
the highest locational probability in this voxel (Eickhoff et al.,


-----

2005). At borders of lateral OFC areas with unmapped or
currently unknown areas (posteriorly adjacent cortex), the
threshold for including a voxel into the MPM of each area
was set to 0.4, resulting in a probability of 40% for each
voxel to be assigned to a specific area (Eickhoff et al., 2005).
The respective areal representations can be accessed and are
available in the JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas[1] as well as
the new BigBrain template of the HBP atlas[2], resembling an
ultrahigh-resolution three-dimensional model of a human brain
at nearly cellular resolution of 20 × 20 µm (Amunts et al.,
2013) and the MNI template of the HBP human brain atlas[3].
In order to compare the data sets in the different template
spaces, vector fields have been calculated based on a 400 µm
isotropic down-sampled volume, to define a homeomorphic
transformation between the BigBrain and the MNI space
(Amunts et al., 2013).

## Volumetric Analysis
Individual shrinkage factors were obtained for each postmortem
brain (Amunts et al., 2007). The ratio of the fresh brain
volume was therefore divided by its volume after histological
processing, further multiplied with the mean specific density
of 1.033 g/mm[3] (Zilles et al., 1988). Volume correction
was obtained by calculation of areal proportions in each
brain to enable the comparison between all brains due to
their differing weight. A contrasting estimate was calculated
between the means of grouped gender and hemispheres using
in-house software written in MatLab (The MathWorks, Inc.,
Natick, MA, USA) as well as pair-wise permutation tests
to detect significant differences of the volume proportion
between the lateral OFC areas. The null distribution was
estimated using Monte-Carlo simulation with a repetition of
1,000,000 iterations. The difference between all four areas was
considered significant if the contrast estimate of the comparison
exceeded 95% of the values under random distribution
(P < 0.05).

## Analysis of Macro Anatomical Pattern in an Extended Sample of Brains
Considering the significant intersubject variability in the sulcal
and gyral pattern of the lateral OFC, we investigated the
individual macroanatomy of the OFC on images of the basal
and lateral views of 26 human postmortem brains of the JuBrain
Cytoarchitectonic Atlas, which were used in the past years for
mapping (for an overview, see Amunts and Zilles, 2015). The
10 postmortem brains used for the cytoarchitectonic mapping
and analysis were part of this sample. Previous studies (Ono et al.,
1990; Chiavaras et al., 2001; Rodrigues et al., 2015) proposed
three or four different sulcal patterns, which we applied. This
resulted in a classification of four types of patterns of sulci and
gyri in the 52 hemispheres. The paths of the respective sulci of
the orbitofrontal cortex (OFC) were traced in the histological
sections of the brains and labeled in the ventral views of the
images of the postmortem brains.

## Functional Decoding of Areas in the Lateral OFC
The BrainMap[4] database includes a large number of search
criteria to limit the exploration for matching studies. On the
experimental level, behavioral domains (BDs) and paradigm
classes (PCs) enabled the specification of given experiments
and the functional decoding of examined VOIs. Functional
decoding of a given seed region involved the acquisition of
all detectable functions by the over-representation of BDs
and PCs in the experiments activating each VOI relative to
the BrainMap database (Eickhoff et al., 2011). Studies with
functional imaging data showing peak x-y-z-coordinates were
explored using the following search criteria: normal mapping,
activations only, using either fMRI or PET studies and only
healthy subjects were included (Laird et al., 2011). This approach
yielded a total number of 1,167 functional neuroimaging
experiments at the time of analysis (Supplementary
**Table S1). No preselection of taxonomic categories had**
been conducted.
Functional characterization using BrainMap’s metadata was
visualized with bar graphs displaying all BDs and PCs for
every examined VOI with their respective probability likelihood
ratio, indicating activation in each area by a particular BD
and PC using forward and reverse inference. The former
approach describes the probability of the observation of activity
in a brain region, given the knowledge of the psychological
process, whereas reverse inference defines the probability of a
psychological process being present, given the knowledge of
activation in a particular brain region. The respective bar graphs
were transformed into network diagrams.

## Meta-analytic Connectivity Modeling on the Lateral OFC Areas
MACM was performed using the activation likelihood
estimation (ALE) algorithm. It identified coincided wholebrain co-activation patterns from the neuroimaging study
contingent of the BrainMap database as peak x-y-z coordinates
in stereotaxic space for each lateral OFC seed region. Here,
similarities in co-activation profiles of each VOI (Eickhoff
et al., 2011) were extracted as activation foci from all matching
neuroimaging studies showing potential functional co-activation
and were displayed on the MNI ICBM 152 brain template.
The MNI ICBM 152 reference space consists of brain scans
from 152 different subjects. They were non-linearly registered
in the MNI ICBM 152 coordinate system, and averaged.
To establish a null-distribution reflecting a random spatial
association between experiments, 10,000 permutations were
calculated. All analyses were thresholded at an FWE-corrected
threshold of P < 0.05 using the cluster-level FWE thresholding
(Eickhoff et al., 2016).
In this context, we performed a conjunction analysis in which
overlap of all four MACM co-activation maps was conducted.
This allowed us to find out which brain regions were affected by
all four lateral OFC areas. Additionally, contrast analyses were

[4http://brainmap.org](http://brainmap.org)


-----

performed on each of the co-activation maps of the four lateral
OFC areas with two contrasting co-activation patterns at a time
to demonstrate any differing functional connectivity between the
two respective seed VOIs and to identify unique functions for
each area per hemisphere (Eickhoff et al., 2011).

## RESULTS

 Cytoarchitecture of Areas Fo4–Fo7
The cytoarchitectonic analysis of the lateral OFC revealed four
new areas (Figure 2): Fo4 was located at the AOG, lateral to
area Fo3, which occupied the medial orbital gyrus and sulcus.


Area Fo5 was spreading over the most anterior tip of the
IFG, posterolateral to the frontomarginal sulcus (FMS) and
ventrolateral to frontal polar area Fp1 (Bludau et al., 2014).
Fo6 was encompassing the LOG following Fo5 posteriorly,
and Fo7 was mostly occupying the lateral orbital sulcus and
gyrus medial to Fo6, following Fo4 posteriorly; it did not
exceed the TOS.
Each area had a specific cytoarchitecture. Layer II of area Fo4
(Figure 3) was thin and loosely occupied by granule cells. Layer
III was broad as compared to the other layers, and loosely packed
by pyramidal cells, especially in layer IIIa and IIIb. In addition,
all cells showed a relatively uniform size, except for sublayer IIIc


-----

showing slightly larger pyramidal cells. The thin layer IV was
almost dysgranular. Layer V showed rather small pyramidal cells,
but bigger than in sublayer IIIc. It was subdivided into sublayers
Va and Vb. Cells in sublayer VIa were bigger and more densely
packed than in sublayer VIb. Layer VI showed a rather smooth
transition to the white matter.
Layer II of area Fo5 was also thin but tended to be thicker
than in Fo4, and more cell dense. Sublayers IIIa and b displayed
small-sized pyramidal cells with an increased cell size towards
sublayer IIIc (Figure 3). Layer III showed a moderate cell density
with lower amounts of cells than in the adjacent layers. Layer IV
was also thin, but broader than in Fo4 and more populated with
granule cells. Sublayer Va contained some large pyramidal cells,
and sublayer Vb was more densely occupied than the analogs
sublayer in area Fo4 (Figure 3). Sublayer VIa showed a higher
cell density than layer V. The cortex-white matter border was also
not sharp.
Compared to area Fo5, area Fo6 (Figure 3) had a slightly
broader, but less cell-dense layer II with no sharp border to
sublayer IIIa. Layer III was also less cell-dense. It showed
medium-sized pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc, and a decreasing
cell size going towards the outer layers IIIb and IIIa. In addition,
it contained larger pyramidal cells than in layer III of Fo5. Layer
IV was wider and better visible than in areas Fo4 and Fo5,
and more densely packed than Fo4, but not Fo5. Sublayer Va
revealed prominent pyramidal cells, close to layer IV. Sublayer
Vb showed a lower cell density than in Fo4 and Fo5. Similar
to Fo4, sublayer VIa of area Fo6 was more densely packed with
cells, but, in contrast to Fo4, showed a clear cut border to the
white matter.
Area Fo7 (Figure 3) showed a more pronounced laminar
pattern than the other three areas. Fo7 was characterized by large
pyramidal cells in layer IIIc and a high cell density. Layer II
was broad and contained uniformly sized granule cells. It was
followed by a broad and densely packed layer III. Sublayer IIIc
contained many large pyramidal cells and also smaller cells in IIIa
and b. The broad and cell dense layer IV was also entangled with
cells from sublayers IIIc and Va. Sublayer Va also showed large
pyramidal cells, but smaller than those of IIIc. Sublayer Vb was
the least cell dense. As in area Fo6, the transition between cortex
and white matter was also clear-cut.
An example of a cytoarchitectonic border between Fo6 and
Fo7 is shown in Figure 4. Compared to Fo6, Fo7 was
characterized by a wide and cell dense layer III. In addition,
the internal granular and pyramidal layers were accentuated
by higher cell densities and cortex width. The thickness of
layer VI appeared to be narrower in Fo7 than Fo6 in cortical
regions with the comparative angle of sectioning. At the same
time, it was more cell dense in sublayer VIa and exhibited
an even better visible border to the white matter in sublayer
VIb than Fo6.
The anterior ramus of the horizontal fissure formed a
macroscopical landmark of Fo6 to the adjacent area 46.
Posteromedial parts of the LOG and the entire lateral orbital
sulcus were inhabited by Fo7, which was following Fo4 on the
AOG, in few cases separated by an intermediate sulcus, ending
in the TOS and slowly being cornered medially and posteriorly


by new areas of the posterolateral orbital region which are still to
be delineated.

## Differentiation of Areas Fo4–Fo7 From Neighboring Areas
The direct neighboring areas were frontopolar area Fp1
(Bludau et al., 2014) at the lateral surface of the frontal
pole, anteriorly to Fo4 and Fo5, and Fo3 (Henssen et al.,
2016) in the medial OFC. Fo3 bordered medially to Fo4.
Additional orbitofrontal areas were located posteriorly to
Fo6 and Fo7, but their cytoarchitecture has not yet been
analyzed in detail. Area 46 was found lateral to area
Fo6, beyond the horizontal ramus of the lateral fissure
(Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995).
In most hemispheres, borders between areas Fp1 (Bludau
et al., 2014) and Fo4 were found at the onset of the AOG,
where Fo4 was following Fp1 posteriorly and was being medially
cornered by Fo3 and laterally by Fo5 (Figure 5, upper panel).
No clear macroscopical landmark was found between Fp1 and
Fo4. Fo5 was located basolaterally to Fp1. Both areas shared
borders in the most frontal part of the IFG right below the
FMS (Figure 5, lower panel), which served as a macroscopical
landmark separating both areas.
The medial orbital sulcus was associated as the macroscopical
landmark between Fo3 (Henssen et al., 2016) and Fo4, with
the latter area being located laterally to the sulcus. Borders
between all cortical layers were better distinguishable in Fo4 than
Fo3 (Figure 6).
The cytoarchitecture of these areas is summarized in

**Table 2. All areas were clearly separable from each other and**
exhibited distinct cytoarchitectonic characteristics representing
true structural differences.

## Hierarchical Cluster Analysis of Cytoarchitectonic Differences and Similarities in the Lateral OFC
The hierarchical cluster analysis of areas Fp1, Fo3, Fo4, Fo5,
Fo6, Fo7 and area 45 as an additional area from the ventral
prefrontal cortex revealed a twofold clustering of areas with
area 45 of the IFG on one branch, and all the other areas

areas of the lateral OFC showed rather low degrees of structural
dissimilarity. An increased degree of structural dissimilarity
was found between the lateral OFC areas and Fo3 and Fp1,
respectively. Area 45 was quite different from the areas of
the lateral OFC, mostly due to its very large pyramidal cells
in layer IIIc, not found in any other area adjacent to the

from the four lateral OFC areas on a higher hierarchical
level. Fo4 and Fo6 were structurally more similar to each
other than to Fo5 and Fo7, which was already visible in the
cytoarchitectonic analysis. Fo5 and Fo7 differed from Fo4 and
Fo6 by a denser cortex and larger cells in sublayer IIIc. The

## Cytoarchitectonic 3D-Maps and Intersubject Variability in Space
The intersubject variability of the four lateral OFC areas was
quantified, and shown as probabilistic maps in the anatomical
MNI reference space (Figure 8). An inflated version of the
JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas visualized the areas in the depths
of the sulci. Fo4 occupied the AOG in all 10 brains (red area in
the center). Fo5 was predominantly present in the most anterior
part of the IFG and also reached into the lateral orbital sulcus and
the FMS. Fo6 occupied the LOG and its medially adjacent lateral
orbital sulcus with a rather low probability of being present in the
horizontal ramus of the lateral sulcus. Fo7 was likely to be found
in the lateral orbital sulcus, also inhabiting the medial half of the
LOG, as well as the posterior part of the medial orbital sulcus.
The coordinates of all analyzed areas were provided in Table 3
for the MNI reference spaces MNI Colin27 and MNI ICBM 152.
The MPM of all four lateral OFC areas and their
respective neighbors represented a non-overlapping


portrayal of the occupying surface representations. Surface
representations of the MPM showed the extent of the
areas with respect to gyri and sulci (Figure 9). In addition,
cytoarchitectonically delineated areas neighboring the lateral
OFC, i.e., Fp1 and Fo3, as well as Fo1, Fo2, area 44 and area
45 were displayed.

The volume of Fo5 was the smallest in this region, followed by
Fo7, Fo4, and Fo6 as the largest area (Supplementary Table S2).

hemisphere 3,126 ± 549 mm[3]. Female brains had a volume of
3,075 ± 335 mm[3] in the left, and 3,133 ± 237 mm[3] in the right
hemisphere. Male brains had a volume of 3,147 ± 796 mm[3]

in the left, and 3,119 ± 788 mm[3] in the right hemisphere.
All areal volumes were calculated for the shrinkage corrected
brain volumes in each hemisphere. Using a permutation test,
neither significant differences between the female and male
brains, or left and right hemispheres were detected. The


total cortical volume of all lateral OFC areas combined was
6,208 ± 492 mm[3] in females, and 6,268 ± 1,576 mm[3] in
males. In both genders, the proportional distribution of left
and right hemispheric lateral OFC was 49.5% and 50.5%,
respectively, in females as well as 50.3% and 49.8%, respectively,
in males.

## Macroanatomical Patterns and Their Variability
The macroanatomy of the OFC included a variety of different
patterns of gyri and sulci. The different patterns were investigated
on images of the basal views of the 52 hemispheres. Four
different sulcal pattern types (one with two subtypes) were
found according to the criteria of Chiavaras and Petrides
(2000) and Chiavaras et al. (2001) as well as Rodrigues
et al. (2015; Figure 10). Sulcal patterns were rather similar
between the hemispheres in 13 out of 26 brains. The other
half showed more pronounced interhemispheric differences in
sulcus patterns. Interhemispheric differences were found in
the anterior and posterior orbital gyrus and the medial and
LOG, respectively, based on the formations of the medial,
lateral and TOS.
The first type of pattern was formed by a segmented medial
orbital sulcus, which consisted of a rostral and a caudal portion
(Figure 10, Type I). The lateral orbital sulcus formed one single
segment, and the TOS connected the caudal portions of the
medial and lateral orbital sulcus. Of the 52 hemispheres, four
left and nine right hemispheres distributed this pattern type (see
**Supplementary Figure S3).**
The second pattern type could be divided into two different
subtypes. The first subtype resembled the shape of the letter ‘‘H’’.
The medial and lateral orbital sulcus formed the two vertical
‘‘legs’’ and the TOS formed the connection between them. The
AOG was separated from the posterior orbital gyrus (Figure 10,
Type II). Additionally, an ‘‘X ’’-pattern subtype was found. It
was characterized by a short and barely segmented AOG. The
medial orbital gyrus was touching the LOG and a barely visible
TOS connected the caudal portions of the former two sulci.
In the more pronounced H-pattern the TOS was still relatively
short, while in the X-pattern it almost completely disappeared.
From all 52 hemispheres, 16 revealed the H-subtype in the
left and 8 in the right hemisphere. Additionally, three out of
52 hemispheres showed the X-subtype in the left and right
hemispheres, respectively.
The third pattern was characterized by a prominent TOS
dividing the posterior orbital gyrus from all other gyri (Figure 10,
Type III). Both, the medial and lateral orbital sulcus were
separated into rostral and caudal parts and only the caudal
sulci were connected through the TOS. Out of all examined
hemispheres, only one demonstrated this type in the left and four
in the right hemisphere.
The fourth pattern type was characterized by a continuous
medial orbital sulcus and a fragmented lateral orbital sulcus,
the counterpart of the first pattern type so to speak (Figure 10,
Type IV). The length of the TOS varied but was longer than
in the X-subtype of the second pattern. Of the 52 analyzed

## Coordinate-Based Meta-analysis of Functional Imaging Studies Reporting Activations in the Lateral OFC Areas
With MACM, conjunctional analysis enabled the detection
of all co-activational patterns in each lateral OFC area in
both hemispheres (Figure 11). All lateral OFC areas showed
co-activational connectivity with Broca’s region, the intraparietal
sulcus, the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex as well as the Wernicke
area. In addition, contrast analyses revealed differences in
co-activation comparing two lateral OFC areas one at a
time between the hemispheres (Supplementary Figure S4).
All co-activation results were summarized in Supplementary
**Table S3.**
Using the SPM Anatomy Toolbox (Eickhoff et al., 2005),
co-activational clustering of the examined VOIs was connected
with the cytoarchitectonically delineated areas of the JuBrain
Cytoarchitectonic Atlas[5] (Supplementary Tables S3, S4). The
eight co-activational clusters of Fo4 represented co-activations
with hIP1 and hIP3 (Choi et al., 2006) in both hemispheres,
left area 2 (Grefkes et al., 2001), left and right area Fp1 (Bludau
et al., 2014) as well as area Fo3 (Henssen et al., 2016), and left
area 44 (Amunts et al., 2004). Fo5 showed co-activation with
hIP1, hIP2, hIP3, areas 44 and 45, Fp1, Fo3 and area 2, each in
both hemispheres and right inferior parietal area PFm (Caspers
et al., 2006, 2008). Fo6 revealed co-activational patterns with left
areas 44 and 45, as well as being strongly connected with hIP1,
hIP2, hIP3, right area PFm and right area PGa (Caspers et al.,
2006, 2008). Different from the other three lateral OFC areas,
Fo7 showed co-activation with left area s32 (Vogt et al., 2013),
left area Fp2 (Bludau et al., 2014), right area Fo3, left amygdala
(laterobasal and centromedial nucleus) and the CA1 region of the
left hippocampus as well as left area 45 and the left hippocampal
amygdaloid transition area (Amunts et al., 2005).

The analysis of BDs and PCs resulted in different area-specific
task-related functionalities based on the neuroimaging studies of
the BrainMap database (Supplementary Figure S5 and Table 4).
Hemispheric differences were detected in all four lateral OFC
areas. Left Fo4 was involved in perceiving gustational input and
taste. Left Fo5 had a strong bias towards reward processing and
left Fo6 was activated during the processing of semantics in
language-based tasks. Left Fo7 also showed activation in tasks
concerning orthography, semantics, memory and gustational
perception. The right Fo4 and Fo5 were co-activated while
retrieving memory, right Fo5 and Fo6 share activities in the
perception of touch, both comforting and painful. Also, activity
while processing emotional behavior tasks was being observed
in right Fo6, especially anger and disgust. Additionally, right
Fo7 was active in face recognition tasks. Linking relationships
between the four areas were also observed in other cognitive
processes, e.g., areas Fo4, Fo5 and Fo7 were being activated in
actions involving working memory. Areas Fo6 and Fo7 were
active while conduction of tasks concerning attention as well as
emotional induction.

## DISCUSSION

In the present study, four new cytoarchitectonic areas, Fo4, Fo5,
Fo6, and Fo7, of the lateral OFC were identified, analyzed and
mapped in 10 human postmortem brains. Their variable location
and extent were reflected in the cytoarchitectonic probabilistic
maps in two reference spaces, the MNI Colin27 space and
the MNI ICBM 152 space. Co-activations and functional
specifics of these areas showed area-specific functional
connectivities with other brain regions. BDs and PCs
showed lateralization towards a rational left-hemispheric
lateral OFC and an emotional right-hemispheric
lateral OFC.
The macroanatomy of the OFC revealed a variety of gyral
and sulcal patterns. The medial and lateral orbital sulcus were

connected through the TOS forming a bridge between the two
former sulci. The TOS developed a distinct AOG and a visible
separation of the posterior orbital gyrus from the other adjacent
gyri. Several studies have identified similar shapes of sulci and
gyri in the OFC and suggest a considerable interindividual
variability. The work by Chiavaras and Petrides (2000) and
Chiavaras et al. (2001) conducted an in-depth analysis of the
orbital surface of the macaque and the human brain. Their
work showed three different types of sulcal patterns based
on the spatial variability in the OFC’s anatomy, which could
be partially applied to the data of the present study. The
ontological development of the brain changed the course of
the gyri and sulci in a considerable way. The different patterns
could be explained by various genetic and environmental
factors. Chi et al. (1977) defined an increasing mediolateral
and caudorostral trend of the OFC’s sulci, due to their varying
chronology in the gestational formation. According to Chi, the
lateral orbital sulcus is developing in the 32–35 weeks and
the TOS later, at 36 weeks of gestation. All intermediate sulci
emerge later at 40–44 weeks of gestation. Certain events, such
as hereditary diseases caused by genetic mutations, metabolic
disorders, environmental influences, etc., can influence the
formation of the gyri and sulci in the fetal brain. Chiavaras
_postulated that sulci appearing early in gestation were more_
constant, whereas sulci appearing later were more variable
(Chiavaras et al., 2001).
In addition, Rodrigues et al. (2015) have identified four
different types of patterns of gyri and sulci in the OFC. Their
patterning was supported by our discoveries, with the medial
and lateral orbital sulcus being connected through a pronounced
TOS or a complete separation of the sulci flowing into a less
developed TOS. In contrast to Chiavaras and Petrides (2000),
Rodrigues et al. (2015) extended their pattern detection by a
fourth pattern, in which the lateral orbital sulcus was separated
into rostral and caudal portions, but the medial orbital sulcus


was longitudinally intact throughout the OFC region. Other
authors also identified varying arrangements of sulci and gyri
in the whole OFC. Earlier on, Ono et al. (1990) were able to
find differing sulcal compositions. Inspecting the medial and
lateral orbital sulcus, they postulated a division into anterior
and posterior portions and found three different pattern types
in the anterior parts of the OFC and four different types in
the posterior OFC (Ono et al., 1990). More importantly, the
number of sulci in the orbital region was also supported by our
inspections. Ono et al. (1990) found three sulci ascending from
the TOS which is analogous to our rostral portions of the medial
and lateral orbital sulcus, as well as the intermediate orbital
sulcus. In addition, two descending sulci were found posteriorly,
which are equal to our caudal portions of the medial and lateral
orbital sulcus. The classification of the sulci in the OFC also
corresponded to that of the Automated Anatomical Labeling
(AAL) atlas[6], which was based on data from Chiavaras and
Petrides (2000) and Chiavaras et al. (2001) and is now available
online in its third version (Rolls et al., 2015). Rolls postulated
that the AOG was inhabited by area 11 l (lateral), and the
LOG by area 47/12 (Rolls et al., 2015). The former designations
are based on Brodmann (1909), Öngür and Price (2000) and
Öngür et al. (2003).

## Comparison to Previous OFC Maps and Methodical Limitations
von Economo and Koskinas (1925) delineated five areas in
the OFC: FDp, FEF, FF, FFa and FFφ (Von Economo, 1929).
Frontal areas FDp and FFφ matched our delineated areas
Fo5 and Fo6 in location and cytoarchitecture, respectively. The
corresponding areal equivalent to area Fo4 was located in the
FEF area. Furthermore, area FF extends topographically over
the entire posterior orbital gyrus as well as the lateral orbital
sulcus in which our Fo7 is located, but which does not exceed
the TOS. Öngür and Price (2000) and Öngür et al. (2003)
had identified four different areas in the lateral OFC, but just
three matched our areas in location and structure, namely
47/12r in the rostral part of the lateral OFC corresponding
to our area Fo5, the anterior part of 47/12 m analogous to
our area Fo4, and 47/12l in the lateral parts of the ventral
surface equivalent to our area Fo6. The reason for a missing
locational or structural areal equivalent for area Fo7 was the
fact that Öngür did not describe any areas hidden in the
sulcal parts of the orbital surface. Nevertheless, their described
laminar patterns were equal to our delineations of areas Fo4,
Fo5 and Fo6. They found a sub laminated layer V and horizontal
striations in layers III/IV in 47/12 m (Fo4), a granular layer
IV in 47/12r (Fo5), and 47/12l (Fo6) being characterized by a
stronger granular layer IV as well as large pyramidal cells in
layer III, sharply demarcated layers and a sub laminated layer V
(Öngür et al., 2003).
The identification of cytoarchitectonic areas of the lateral
OFC was based on the Mahalanobis distance as a measure
of cytoarchitectonic differences. Many studies of the past had
identified boundaries between adjacent areas in a reproducible

[6http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aal/](http://www.gin.cnrs.fr/en/tools/aal/)


-----

manner (Schleicher et al., 1998, 1999). It is less sensitive to
gradual changes in the laminar pattern due to the integration
of the covariance matrix changing at abrupt changes in
cytoarchitecture between cortical areas (Schleicher et al., 1999;
Morosan et al., 2001; Zilles et al., 2002). In order to consider
differences in cortical geometry, the Mahalanobis distance was
calculated for different block sizes of neighboring profiles
(Schleicher et al., 1998). Borders were only accepted when
the distance was significant for a large number of block
sizes. Cortical regions, which were heavily tangentially cut,
could not be analyzed by this method and were excluded
(Amunts et al., 1999; Schleicher et al., 1999, 2000, 2005).
Tangential sectioning of the cytoarchitecture represented a
limitation to any type of analysis in 2D. However, alternative
methods for cortical parcellation are under development, which
use, for example, deep convolutional networks (Spitzer et al.,
2018). In combination with high-resolution 3D models such
as the Big Brain (Amunts et al., 2013), they open a new
perspective to map the brain, independently on the angle of
physical sectioning.

## Functional Connectivity of the Lateral OFC Areas
In agreement with previous studies (Elliott et al., 2000), areas in
the lateral OFC showed co-activational connectivity with areas
of the association cortex, also receiving gustatory and olfactory
input as well as projecting to the central part of the caudate
nucleus (Öngür and Price, 2000), hypothalamus (Rolls, 2000),
hippocampus, amygdala and cingulate cortex (Kringelbach and
Rolls, 2004; Ross et al., 2013). We were able to confirm these
connections and extend them by cytoarchitectonically delineated
areas from the frontal and parietal lobe and parts of the
limbic system.
For areas Fo4 and Fo5, we found co-activations in Fp1
(Bludau et al., 2014), hIP1, hIP2 and hIP3 (Choi et al.,
2006; Scheperjans et al., 2008a,b) in both hemispheres. These
connectivities could explain the functional contribution of
Fo4 and Fo5 in memory and reward processing. Fp1 (Bludau
et al., 2014), which is involved in working memory, planning
and cognition, is in close proximity to Fo4 and Fo5, probably
linked with the anterior OFC areas through association fibers.
Areas hIP1-3 (Choi et al., 2006; Scheperjans et al., 2008a,b)
are also active during working memory, both spatial and object
memory are being processed here. Functional connectivity of
Fo4 to Fo3 (Henssen et al., 2016) could explain Fo4’s activity
in gustational perception, possibly being a secondary gustational
cortex region. The perception of pain with activity in the right
areas Fo5 and Fo6 may also be explained by the functional
connection to area PFm in the right inferior parietal lobule
(Caspers et al., 2006, 2008). Attention reorientation, affective
arousal and cognitive control were known functions of PFm
and could explain the connection to right Fo5 and Fo6, which
probably runs through the superior longitudinal fasciculus,
since only the right PFm was activated. The pars orbitalis
of the IFG is known to be activated in tasks which involve
listening to music as well as in the processing of temporal
coherence in music (Levitin and Menon, 2003). Semantics and


musical structure tend to be related to each other (Levitin and
Menon, 2003), what would explain the activations in the lateral
OFC, especially area Fo6, in semantic tasks (Papathanassiou
et al., 2000; Levitin and Menon, 2003; Amunts et al., 2004;
Zald et al., 2014).
Additionally, areas 44 and 45 (Amunts et al., 2004) were
co-activated with our areas Fo5, Fo6 and Fo7 in the left
hemisphere, adding a language-processing role to them and
broaden the knowledge of already known language-related
cortical areas, as well as including a functional lateralization to
the lateral OFC. Area 44 and 45 are known to be activated in
verbal fluency tasks and left area 45 showed higher activation in
semantic tasks (Amunts et al., 2004). According to Keller et al.
(2009), it was assumed that the cytoarchitectonic differences and
the different co-activation of areas 44 and 45 were also reflected
in different functions. We can confirm this, although our areas
of the lateral OFC are only partially different. We see similarities
rather in areas that are not spatially adjacent. According to the
hierarchical cluster analysis, Fo4 and Fo6 as well as Fo5 and
Fo7 are structurally similar. We cannot confirm these similarities
on the basis of their individual functions.
In contrast to the left hemispheric areas, right Fo5, Fo6 and
Fo7 were more activated in emotion-driven cognitive processes,
probably because of their connections to area s32 in the rectal
gyrus (Vogt et al., 2013; Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2015), Fp2
(Bludau et al., 2014) in the medial frontal polar cortex, the
hippocampus and the laterobasal and centromedial nuclei of
the amygdala (Amunts et al., 2005). Area s32 is known to be
activated in the processing of fear rather than sadness as well
as in the processing of reward (Palomero-Gallagher et al., 2015),
which corresponds to our activations in right Fo5. Area Fp2 was
activated in social cognition and emotional processing (Bludau
et al., 2014), which corresponded well with our functional
discoveries for right areas Fo6 and Fo7. The hippocampus
is well known in memory tasks (Amunts et al., 2005). Its
CA1 region is activated in the processing of autobiographical and
episodic memories among others (Bartsch et al., 2011), which
was consistent with the functions of our right areas Fo5 and
Fo6. Finally, the amygdala is mostly known to be involved in
the processing of emotions, especially fear and fear conditioning
(Sah et al., 2003). This connection gives the right area Fo6 more
importance in the processing of fear and other negative emotions,
such as anger. One possible connection between the amygdaloid
nuclei and the orbital cortex could be the uncinated fasciculus,
which was imaged and described elsewhere (Kier et al., 2004).
The fasciculus extends into the superior, medial and inferior
temporal gyrus as well as into the gyrus rectus, the medial and
lateral orbital cortex and the orbital portion of the IFG (Kier
et al., 2004). Possibly, the right Fo6 receives information with
emotional content from the amygdaloid nuclei, which can then
be analyzed to make decisions appropriate to the context. Actions
may then be adapted accordingly. Also, a weak activation in the
right pars orbitalis of the IFG was detected together with the
adjacent anterior insula while listening to music (Levitin and
Menon, 2003; Alluri et al., 2013). These activations do not need
to be driven either by auditory or linguistic stimuli to process the
temporal coherence of music (Levitin and Menon, 2003).


-----

Our findings indicated that the anterior areas of the lateral
OFC, areas Fo4 and Fo5, were both of importance in working
and explicit memory, which already was reported in various
studies (Rolls, 2000; Wallis, 2007; Rolls and Grabenhorst, 2008;
Ross et al., 2013; Zald et al., 2014). Further, several studies
reported the lateral OFC being activated in reward guidedbehavior (Elliott et al., 2000; Rolls, 2000, 2004; Kringelbach and
Rolls, 2004; Wallis, 2007; Rolls and Grabenhorst, 2008; Zald et al.,
2014; Neubert et al., 2015; Cho et al., 2016; Dalton et al., 2016;
Troiani et al., 2016; Rudebeck et al., 2017; Rudebeck and Rich,
2018), which could be corroborated in the present study for left
area Fo5.
The lateral and posterior located areas Fo6 and Fo7 showed
a more well-defined functional lateralization. Hence, processing
language, especially semantics and orthography, in the left
hemisphere with co-activations in the Broca region (Zald et al.,
2014). The lateral OFC region is also activated in somatosensory
and emotional processing, e.g., anger and disgust, in the right
hemisphere with co-activations in the inferior parietal sulcus
areas hIP1–hIP3 (Choi et al., 2006; Scheperjans et al., 2008a,b),
as well as the amygdala, the hippocampus and the HATA
region (Amunts et al., 2005). These observations were also
reported in past studies (Kringelbach and Rolls, 2004; Nestor
et al., 2013; Ross et al., 2013). According to Elliott et al.
(2000), the right lateral OFC was associated with responses
to angry faces but not to neutral faces, which corresponds
well with our results with right area Fo6 being active while
processing anger. All four examined lateral OFC areas seem
to be involved in higher-order cognitive functions with a
strong lateralization into rational task-based processing in the
left hemisphere and the processing of emotionally charged
behavior in the right hemisphere according to the results of
the functional decoding (see also Supplementary Figure S5
and Table 4).

## CONCLUSION

The statistically reproducible cytoarchitectonical border
detection in 10 postmortem brains allowed to identify four
new cytoarchitectonically distinct areas Fo4, Fo5, Fo6, and
Fo7. Probabilistic maps were computed demonstrating for the
first time their different locational extent and interindividual
variability. The functional meta-analysis of the lateral OFC
assigned individual functions to its areas which revealed an
interhemispheric lateralization. The processing of language and
working memory revealed activations in the left hemisphere
as opposed to the perception of gustational input, physical
pain as well as emotional processing in the right hemisphere.
The new maps of the areas in the lateral OFC were included
in the publicly available JuBrain Cytoarchitectonic Atlas
[(DOI: 10.25493/8EGG-ZAR), furthermore they are available](https://doi.org/10.25493/8EGG-ZAR)
[as separate downloads at the DOIs: 10.25493/29G0-66F (for](https://doi.org/10.25493/29G0-66F)

[(for Fo6), and 10.25493/3WEV-561 (for Fo7). All maps are](https://doi.org/10.25493/3WEV-561)
available in the MNI Colin27 and MNI ICBM 152 reference
spaces. Since the lateral OFC was also natively mapped in
the ‘‘BigBrain,’’ all maps are available in the ‘‘BigBrain’’


space as well. The fact that the maps are offered in different
reference spaces and thus also in different resolutions enables
a specific and adapted use by a broad readership. The here
presented new insights of the lateral OFC may provide a
better understanding of its functional relevance and the new
maps can now be used as an anatomical reference for in vivo
mapping procedures.

## DATA AVAILABILITY STATEMENT

All datasets generated for this study are included in the
article/Supplementary Material.

## ETHICS STATEMENT

Body donors gave written informed consent for the general
use of postmortem tissue used in this study for aims of
research and education. The usage is covered by a vote of the
ethics committee of the medical faculty of the Heinrich Heine
University Düsseldorf (#4863).

## AUTHOR CONTRIBUTIONS

Cytoarchitectonic characterization, statistical border detection
of the lateral OFC areas and statistics were performed and
calculated by MW with support by KA and SC. KA designed
the study. Prior lateral OFC analysis by FG was part of the
analysis. Hierarchical cluster analysis was prepared by MW and
calculated by SB. Volumetric analysis was estimated by HM and
final calculations were made by MW and SB. Probabilistic maps
and MPMs were calculated by HM, final adaptions of these maps
were made by MW. Functional characterization was estimated by
MW and MACM analysis was conducted by MW with support
by SE. Discussion of results and writing were performed by
all co-authors.
