### a b s t r a c t

The architectonical organization of putatively higher auditory areas in the human superior

temporal gyrus and sulcus is not yet well understood. To provide a coherent map of this

part of the brain, which is involved in language and other functions, we examined the

cytoarchitecture and cortical parcellation of this region in histological sections of ten

human postmortem brains using an observer-independent mapping approach. Two new

areas were identified in the temporo-insular region (areas TeI, TI). TeI is medially adjacent

to the primary auditory cortex (area Te1). TI is located between TeI and the insular cortex.

Laterally adjacent to previously mapped areas Te2 and Te3, two new areas (STS1, STS2)

were identified in the superior temporal sulcus. All four areas were mapped over their

whole extent in serial, cell-body stained sections, and their cytoarchitecture was analyzed

using quantitative image analysis and multivariate statistics. Interestingly, area TeI, which

is located between area Te1 and area TI at the transition to the insula, was more similar in

cytoarchitecture to lateral area Te2.1 than to the directly adjacent areas TI and Te1. Such

structural similarity of areas medially and laterally to Te1 would be in line with the core

ebelteparabelt concept in macaques. The cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of all areas

show the localization of the areas and their interindividual variability. The new maps are

publicly available and provide a basis to further explore structuralefunctional relationship

of the language network in the temporal cortex.

### 1. Introduction

Understanding the anatomical foundations of language processing requires disentangling the cortical areas forming the
language network. The language network includes, among
others, aspects of the superior temporal gyrus and sulcus,
located medially and laterally to the primary auditory cortex
(Friederici, 2012). At the same time, this region has also been
attributed to other functions such as Theory of Mind for the
superior temporal sulcus (STS, reviewed in (Hein & Knight,
2008)). To contribute to a better understanding of the role of
STS areas in these functions, we investigated the areal
segregation and cytoarchitecture of this region in more detail,
and computed probabilistic maps in stereotaxic space. While
detailed maps for the anterior part including Broca’s region
have been provided during the last years (Amunts, Schleicher,
Burgel, Mohlberg, Uylings et al., 1999; Amunts, Weiss,
Mohlberg, Pieperhoff, Eickhoff et al., 2004), there is only
sparse knowledge on the cortical segregation of the posterior
language region, which may correspond to parts of Wernicke’s
region (Lichtheim, 1884; Wernicke, 1874). Wernicke’s region
has been conceptualized as a sensory speech region caudal to
the primary auditory cortex at the posterior part of BA22 (see
Fig. 1) and parts of the supramarginal gyrus (BA40) in the left
hemisphere.
Wernicke’s and Lichtheim’s original publications were
anatomically not explicit, and the location of Wernicke’s region was later controversially debated among scientists
(Bogen & Bogen, 1976). A recent meta-analysis of neuroimaging findings (DeWitt & Rauschecker, 2012) reported activations linked to speech processing in the mid-to-anterior
part of the superior temporal gyrus (STG), located laterally to
the primary auditory cortex on Heschl’s gyrus. This result
questions the location of Wernicke’s region in the posterior
STG as the functional ‘center of speech comprehension’
(Binder, 2015, 2017).
Language impairment has been described for different
neurological diseases affecting Wernicke’s region. It was
originally defined in aphasic patients with lesions disturbing
semantic speech processing (Wernicke, 1874), but aphasia is
not limited to the posterior part of the STG. Lesions within the
whole STG can cause aphasia with different clinical symptoms (Mesulam, Rogalski, Wieneke, Hurley, Geula et al., 2014).
For schizophrenia, language deficits (Covington, He, Brown,
Nac¸i, McClain et al., 2005) and acoustic hallucinations
(Diederen, Daalman, de Weijer, Neggers, van Gastel et al.,
2012) are reported, as well as a gray matter loss in the STG
(Matsumoto, Simmons, Williams, Hadjulis, Pipe et al., 2001).
Autistic patients may also suffer from language deficits (Eigsti,
de Marchena, Schuh, Kelley, 2011) and show a hypoperfusion
of the left STG (Gendry Meresse, Zilbovicius, Boddaert, Robel,
Philippe et al., 2005).
Despite the clinical relevance and the various functions for
communication, little is known about the underlying microstructure and cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the temporoinsular and the STS region in the human brain. In former
mapping studies (Fig. 1), e.g., by Brodmann (Brodmann, 1909),
the STS separates BA22 on the superior temporal gyrus (STG)
from BA21 on the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). However,


Brodmann did not show details of the parcellation within the
sulcus, and his map does not indicate the precise course of the
border between BA22 and BA21.
The parcellation proposed by Von Economo and Koskinas
(1925) divided the brain into 107 areas, which are more than
twice as many as Brodmann’s areas. They identified an area
TA on the STG and an area TE1 on the MTG with a common
border in the fundus of the STS. Von Economo and Koskinas
did not find separable areas in the STS, in contrast to later
observations by Hopf (1954), who provided a detailed map of
the temporal areas according to myeloarchitectonic criteria
and identified an additional area profunda (pf) in the STS.
The temporo-insular region in Brodmann’s map (1909) is
equivalent to area BA52 (see Fig. 1). It begins anteriorly with the
Limen insulae and ends caudally with the Margo insularis posterior.
The lateral border is BA41, the medial border is the granular
cortex of the Regio insularis. von Economo and Horn (1930)
described the region between the insular (JBT) and primary
auditorycortex(TC)asthedorsal partofthetemporalpole(TG2).
This latter area was subdivided into two subareas TG2a (lateral)
andTG2b (medial).Itrepresentsatriangularshapedareawithits
broadest part towards the temporal pole. Myeloarchitectonically, this region might be part of the Regio temporalis parainsularis, which Hopf (1954) further divided into 3 subareas and
the R. temporalis separans medialis with its two subareas.

Galaburda and Sanides (1980) investigated the human
auditory cortex on cell-body stained brain sections and identified an area ProA between the insula and the auditory core
areas Kam, Kalt. ProA has features of the insular and temporal
cortices and is therefore the equivalent area of the temporoinsular region described here. This region was also analyzed
on different histochemically stained sections in two studies
(Rivier & Clarke, 1997; Wallace, Johnston, Palmer, 2002), which
found two areas, AA and MA, on the Planum polare, with area
AA being more rostro-lateral than area MA.
The areas identified by different investigators (listed in Table
1) overlap only partially (reviewed for the human auditory cortex in (Moerel, De Martino, Formisano, 2014)). Their exact position and correspondences cannot be directly compared and
related to each other. This is partly due to the difficulties in
depicting the sulcal surface on a 2D drawing, while a common
spatial reference space would provide a framework to superimpose the different findings. A three-dimensional map of the
STS might be also compared with findings from functional or
structural imaging studies to study the relationship between
behavior, brain function and the underlying microscopical
anatomy. The aim of our study was therefore to provide a 3D
map of the areas on the STG, relying on the same approach as in
our previous studies on primary and secondary auditory cortex
(Morosan, Rademacher, Schleicher, Amunts, Schormann et al.,
2001; Morosan, Schleicher, Amunts, Zilles, 2005). This
approach is based on quantitative image analysis and statistical
criteria for defining borders between areas in serial, cell-body
stained sections of ten human post mortem brains. The areas
were reconstructed and registered to a common 3D reference
space, where the topography and intersubject variability of the
areas can be depicted for each voxel, enabling a direct comparison with in vivo neuroimaging studies. We capitalized on
this possibility by using the new maps as spatial masks to query

associated with each study identified in BrainMap enabled us
to objectively and quantitatively characterize the functional
roles of the new areas.

### 2. Materials and methods

2.1. Histological processing of the post mortem brains

Ten brains (5 female, 5 male, 37e85 years old) from the body
donor program of the Anatomical Institute at the University of


Du¨ sseldorf were used for cytoarchitectonic analysis (see Table
2). Donors gave their written informed consent, according to
the requirements of the Ethics Committee of the University of
Du¨ sseldorf. The subjects did not have any neurological disease, except case pm9, who suffered from transitory motor
deficits. Handedness was not known. The post mortem delay
did not exceed 24 h. After removal from the skull brains were
immersed with 4% formalin or in Bodian’s fixative for at least 6
months, embedded in paraffin (protocols in the supplement)
and completely serially cut into 20 mm coronal sections (Polycut E, Reichert-Jung, Germany). Every 15th section was
mounted on gelatin-covered glass slides and silver-stained for

supplement). Delineation of areas was performed on every
60th section.

2.2. Observer-independent detection of borders based on
the Grey Level Index and analysis of volume

The borders were identified in images of histological sections
using statistical criteria and image analysis (Schleicher,
Morosan, Amunts, Zilles, 2009; Schleicher, PalomeroGallagher, Morosan, Eickhoff, Kowalski et al., 2005). For this
purpose, rectangular regions of interests (ROIs) on histological
sections were digitized (1.01 mm/pixel) with a CCD camera
(AxioCamMRm, Zeiss, mounted on a light microscope Axioplan 2 imaging, Zeiss). ROIs were transferred into Grey Level
Index (GLI) images using in-house MatLab code. The digitized
image was filtered (Gauss filter 1 pixel and 40 pixel), the two
resulting images were subtracted to detect the edges of the
cell bodies and the ROI was transferred to a binary image. This
binary image was superimposed by a 16 � 16 mm grid (see
Bludau et al., 2014). Cells cover different fractions of this grid,
therefore the Grey Level Index (GLI) was calculated as a
measure of the volume fraction of cell bodies in these images
(Wree, Schleicher, Zilles, 1982). The outer contour line (border
between layers I and II) and the inner contour line at the white
matter border were defined. Between these contour lines
curvilinear traverses were calculated (Fig 2C) GLI profiles


were extracted by plotting the GLI values against the cortical
depth as abscissa. Since the cortex differs in thickness, between brain regions and brains, the profiles were normalized
to a standard length (100%), and divided into 10 equidistant
bins. GLI profiles reflect the laminar organization of the cortex,
and were used to quantitatively characterize different areas
and identify borders between them. Each profile was then
described by a ten-element feature vector containing the
mean GLI value, kurtosis, standard deviation and skewness,
as well as the first derivatives of the same elements. The
multivariate distance between feature vectors of neighboring
sets of profiles (block size range from 12 to 24 profiles) was
described by the Mahalanobis distance (MD, Fig. 2A) function
(Mahalanobis, Majumdar, Yeatts, Rao, 1949). MD as a measure
of the dissimilarity of neighboring blocks of profiles was
computed at every profile position using a sliding window
procedure. Maxima in the MD function represent changes in
the laminar organization of the cortex, thus indicating a putative position of a border. Maxima were accepted as relevant
borders, when they were found for at least two block sizes
(Fig. 2B) and in three neighboring sections at the same
position.
The identified areas were labeled over their whole extent in
the high-resolution scans of sections (1200 dpi), and volumes
of the areas were calculated based on stereological principles
in each hemisphere and brain and the volumes were

corrected for the shrinkage (Amunts, Armstrong, Malikovic,
Homke,€ Mohlberg et al., 2007; Amunts, Kedo, Kindler,
Pieperhoff, Mohlberg et al., 2005). Shrinkage factors were
calculated as the ratio between the fresh volume and the
volume after fixation, whereas the fresh volume was estimated from the fresh brain weight and the brain density of
1.033 g/mm[3] mentioned in Kretschmann (1971).

V ¼ s,T,x,y, X Ai,F

V ¼ areal volume [mm[3]]
ti b t


T ¼ section thickness (20 mm).
x, y ¼ length and width of the pixel (21.2 mm).
Ai ¼ areal surface in all measured sections (in pixel).
F ¼ shrinkage factor.

Calculated areal volumes were related to the brain volume
before embedding and the following histological procedures.
These volume fractions of the areas were tested for volume
differences in gender and hemispheres with a pair-wise permutation test (Bludau, Eickhoff, Mohlberg, Caspers, Laird et al.,
2014; Eickhoff, Paus, Caspers, Grosbras, Evans et al., 2007).

2.3. Discriminant analysis of mean areal GLI profiles

Three ROIs were manually selected per hemisphere and area
showing an almost horizontally layered cortex. The three ROIs
were distributed over the whole extent of the area to ensure
that cortical microstructure is representative of the area.
Based on these three ROIs, mean GLI profiles of 45 profiles (15
profiles in each ROI) were calculated. Mean feature vectors
were generated for each area based on these mean GLI profiles. Based on these feature vectors a discriminant analysis
was calculated using the Euclidian distance and the Ward
linking procedures (Ward, 1963). The results were visualized
in a dot plot and differences in the GLI-profiles, i.e., the
laminar pattern of the areas, are shown by confidence ellipses
of the sample means (p > .95).

2.4. 3D-reconstruction of areas and stereotaxic maps

Histological sections of each postmortem brain were 3D
reconstructed. Therefore, the scans of the sections were
registered to the magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) dataset
and blockface images taken prior to histological processing
with in-house software using linear and non-linear transformations to correct for deformations during histological
techniques. By applying the same transformation parameters
as used for the 3D reconstruction of the whole post mortem
brains, the delineated areas were 3D reconstructed and then
registered to the reference space of the T1 weighted, singlesubject template of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
(Collins, Neelin, Peters, Evans, 1994; Evans, Collins, Mills,
Brown, Kelly et al., 1993; Holmes, Hoge, Collins, Woods, Toga
et al., 1998) by using affine transformations and nonlinear
elastic registration (Homke, 2006€ ). They were registered to the
anatomical reference space, which is adjusted to the anterior
commissure as origin of the coordinate system (Amunts et al.,
2005). Probability maps (pmaps) of the analyzed areas from
different individual brains were then calculated, which indicate in how many brains an area is found in a certain voxel.
They reflect the intersubject variability in localization and
extent of the areas. Finally, using the same method, the areas
were also transferred to the average MNI (ICBM 152 casym)
and the so-called BigBrain template (Amunts, Lepage, Borgeat,
Mohlberg, Dickscheid et al., 2013) to offer mapping results in
different, widely used template spaces.
These maps were then annotated and integrated to the
HBP (Human Brain Project) Atlas [(https://www.](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/)
[humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/) as a publicly](https://www.humanbrainproject.eu/en/explore-the-brain/)
[available resource and to the JuBrain atlas (https://jubrain fz](https://jubrain.fz-juelich.de/apps/cytoviewer/cytoviewer.php)


-----

[juelich.de/apps/cytoviewer/cytoviewer.php). On the basis of](https://jubrain.fz-juelich.de/apps/cytoviewer/cytoviewer.php)
the pmaps, a non-overlapping map, i.e., a Maximum Probability Map (MPM) was calculated for each area (Eickhoff et al.,
2007; Eickhoff, Stephan, Mohlberg, Grefkes, Fink et al., 2005).
In the MPM, each voxel was assigned to the area with the
highest probability.

2.5. Quantitative functional profiling

To assess the functional significance of the cytoarchitectonically delineated brain areas in an objective and quantitative
manner, we analyzed the association of these regions with
descriptors for cognitive processes as provided by the Brain[Map database (www.brainmap.org (Laird, Eickhoff, Kurth, Fox,](http://www.brainmap.org)
Uecker et al., 2009)). This curated database contains the result
coordinates from thousands of published task-related neuroimaging studies along with meta-data that describe the
paradigm class (i.e., the specific task category) employed by
any given experiment according to a pre-specified taxonomy
[((Fox, Laird, Fox, Fox, Uecker et al., 2005); see www.brainmap.](http://www.brainmap.org/scribe)
[org/scribe). By filtering the database for experiments reporting](http://www.brainmap.org/scribe)
activation in a given area of interest and statistically analyzing
the psychological descriptor (paradigm class, PC) of the
selected experiments, functional roles of individual areas can
be objectively characterized. Our analysis was based on 7937
normal mapping experiments performed in healthy adults,
“ ”
excluding intervention studies and comparisons between
samples from different populations. Numbers of studies
included in the analysis for each cytoarchitectonic area are
listed in Supplementary Table S1.
We analyzed the functional descriptors of BrainMap experiments associated with each of our areas of interest by way
of forward and reverse inference. Forward inference tested
whether the probability of finding activation in the area of
interest given a particular paradigm class [P(Activation | PC)]
was higher than the baseline probability of finding activation
in that area across the entire database [P(Activation)]. Binomial tests were employed to assess significance at p < .05,
corrected for multiple comparisons by controlling the falsediscovery rate (FDR). Reverse inference identified the most
likely PCs given activation in the area of interest. This likelihood [P(PC | Activation)] was derived from P(Activation | PC),
P(PC) and P(Activation) according to Bayes’ rule. Its significance was assessed by chi-square tests (p < .05, FDR-corrected
for multiple comparisons).
The specificity and commonalities of the functional profiles of a given pair of areas (e.g., left vs right homotopic regions) were examined via contrast and conjunction analyses,
respectively. These analyses were restricted to those experiments in BrainMap that activated either area of a given pair,
making them somewhat less conservative than the tests for
main effects against the entire database, as described above.
For differential forward inference, we compared the activation probabilities between two areas given a particular PC; for
differential reverse inference, we compared the probabilities
of a particular PC being employed given activation in one
versus the other area of a given pair (Eickhoff, Bzdok, Laird,
Roski, Caspers et al., 2011; Langner, Cieslik, Behrwind, Roski,
Caspers et al., 2015). The results of these quantitative comi th h ld d t < 05 (FDR t d f


multiple comparisons). For both forward and reverse inference, conjunction analyses using the strict minimum t-statistic identified significant intersections of PCs between the
two areas of a given pair thresholded at p < .05 (Bonferronicorrected for multiple comparisons).

2.6. Surface-based representation of the areas in the
BigBrain

The new areas were additionally mapped in the BigBrain
(Amunts et al., 2013), which was the elevenths brain, using the
same mapping approach as for the brains forming the data
basis of the pmaps. The mapping of the areas in the BigBrain
(Table 2, BC20) resulted in a 3D representation with high inplane and out-of-plane resolution (distance between sections
up to 300 mm). This is important in particular for the small and
geometrically complex areas such as TI. Maps of the areas were
reconstructed in 3D and projected on surfaces models of the
[BigBrain data set (publicly available at the website https://](https://bigbrain.loris.ca)
[bigbrain.loris.ca). To ensure that the areal surface is not over-](https://bigbrain.loris.ca)
or underestimated, which may occur in case of the complex
geometry of the sulcal areas, we computed a middle cortical
surface from the provided inner and outer surfaces (Fig. 3). The
volume labels were projected onto this middle surface and for
every cytoarchitectonic area an unambiguous label was
assigned to each vertex point of the triangulated surface. The
surface area of the cytoarchitectonic areas with label A was
calculated by adding up the areas of all triangular areas
belonging to a vertex label A multiplied by one third. Volumes
of brain areas were calculated by multiplying the areal surface
by the mean cortical thickness of the area Ai. In addition, the
exact geometric volume defined by the polyhedron volume
enclosed between the inner and outer surface was calculated
for a comparison with the mean areal volumes and to decide
whether the mean areal surface is a good approximation for the
areal extent. The difference between the middle volume and
the geometrical volume was less than 4%.

2.7. Cytoarchitectonic analysis of neighboring,
previously mapped areas

Previously mapped areas Te2.1 and Te2.2 (Clarke & Morosan,
2012; Morosan, Rademacher, Palomero-Gallagher,Zilles,
2005) of the Planum temporale (Figs. 1 and 4) were reanalyzed, to obtain the same set of data as in the present
study, and to compare them between each other without a
methodical bias. GLI profiles of the previous study were used
for cluster- and volumetric analysis. Probability maps and
maximum probability maps of areas Te2.1 and Te2.2 were recalculated with present tools to create a consistent and
complete map of the (posterior) superior temporal gyrus.

### 3. Results

Four new areas, TeI and TI in the temporo-insular region and
STS1 and STS2 in the mid to anterior STS, were identified. The
areas are adjacent to the previously described areas Te1, Te2
and Te3 (Fig. 4). As a result, a complete map covering the superior temporal gyrus was computed

(Wagstyl, Lepage, Bludau, Zilles, Fletcher et al., 2018). The
temporo-insular area TI (green) is shown in the insert in
coronal plane. For the surface-based representation of the
areas, the middle surface (dashed line) was calculated.

Fig. 4 e Localization of the STG areas on a coronal section.
Coronal section of the temporal lobe (position indicated in
insert). The areas TI and TeI are medially adjacent to the
primary auditory cortex (Te1) close to the insular cortex.
The secondary auditory areas Te2.1 and Te2.2 are sulcal
areas, and do not reach crown of the superior temporal
gyrus (STG), where Te3 starts. STS1 and STS2 are located in
the superior temporal sulcus (STS), and occupy its lower
and upper bank, respectively. Area MTG1 is a yet
uncharted region of the middle temporal gyrus (MTG),
laterally adjacent to STS2.

3.1. Cytoarchitecture of areas TeI and TI

The temporo-insular region consists of two distinct areas, TeI
and TI. TeI represents the more lateral one, directly adjacent


to the primary auditory cortex (Te1). TI is more medially
located, close to the circular sulcus and the insular cortex. TeI
has, in comparison to TI, a slightly broader and more densely
packed layer II (Fig. 5C). The medium sized cells in layer III are
equally distributed in TI with the highest density in layer IIIb
as compared to TeI where this maximal density is found in
IIIc. Generally, layer III seems to be less dense in TI than in TeI.
In TeI the cells of layer III show a columnar like appearance.
The other layers show less pronounced differences between
these two areas, but are clearly distinct from the primary
auditory and insular cortex.
TeI and TI can be distinguished from the primary auditory
and insular cortex by a dense layer II and densely packed
layers V and VI with small to medium sized cells (Fig. 5B and
D). In contrast to Te1, TeI has higher cell densities in layers V
and VI (Fig. 5B). Besides, Te1 has larger pyramidal cells in layer
III which show a more obvious columnar distribution. Layer IV
has more granular cells in Te1 than in TeI.
The insular area Id1 (Kurth, Eickhoff, Schleicher, Hoemke,
Zilles et al., 2010) can be separated from TI by a less dense
layer II which shows no clear-cut border towards layer III
(Fig. 5D). The pyramidal cells in layer III are smaller and the
cell density increases towards area TI. The granular cells of
layer IV are loosely packed in Id1. Layer V has medium sized
pyramidal cells in Id1. Layer V and VI are broader in area TI
than Id1.

3.2. Cytoarchitecture of areas STS1 and STS2

Area STS1 has a dense layer II with no sharp border towards
layer III. Layer IIIc has smaller pyramidal cells compared to
area Te3 (Fig. 6D). The granular cells in layer IV are organized
in clusters and the layer appears relatively broad. Layer V is
less dense than layer VI. Layer VI is clearly visible and has a
sharp boundary towards the white matter. Area STS2 has a
dense and compact layer II with a sharp border towards layer
III (Fig. 6C). Layer III is dominated by medium to large elongated pyramidal cells in IIIc, which covers nearly half of layer
III. Layer IV is relatively broad and columnar organized. The
cells in layers V and VI are of the same size and distribution so
that the border between V and VI is not always clearly visible.
The white-matter border is relatively sharp.
Areas STS1 and STS2 can be clearly distinguished from
neighboring areas. Dorsal to STS1, there is a long-stretched
area on the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus, Te3
(Morosan, Schleicher, et al., 2005; Fig. 6D). It has broad granular layers II and IV. Layer IIIc is prominent. It consists of large
and densely packed pyramidal cells. Layer V is rather cell
dense. The cells are vertically organized in columns ( organ
“
pipes by Von Economo & Koskinas, 1925). The inner granular
”
layer is thicker in Te3 than in STS1. Te3 has no sharp cortex/
white-matter boundary.
Ventral to areas STS1 and STS2 we identified a yet unmapped area at the middle temporal gyrus (MTG), which we
called MTG1 (Fig. 6A). MTG1 is characterized by a less dense
layer II, which is broader in MTG1 than in STS2, and has no
sharp border to layer III. Layer III a/b has a low cell density.
Layer IIIc is thinner than in STS2 without prominent large
pyramidal cells at the transition to layer IV. It appears as a

light, cell sparse ribbon. Layers III and V have a less prominent
columnar organization than STS2. Layer V has larger pyramids in its superficial part, close to layer IV. Towards layer VI,
the pyramidal cells become smaller and less cell dense.

3.3. Cytoarchitecture of areas Te2.1 and Te2.2

Based on previous research of our group, we extended the current analysis with data from the secondary auditory areas Te2.1
and Te2.2 (Clarke & Morosan, 2012; Morosan,Rademacher, etal.,
2005) and the primary auditory cortex (Morosan et al., 2001), and
compared their cytoarchitecture based on image analysis and
multivariate statistics (Fig. 7). Areas Te2.1 and Te2.2 are located
between the primary auditory cortex, area Te1, and area Te3 on
the superior temporal gyrus.
Area Te2.1 has a large and cell sparse layer III and thin, but
cell dense layers V and VI. It can be clearly delineated from the
koniocortical area Te1 with its prominent layer IV (Fig. 7B). In
contrast to Te2.1, area Te2.2 (Fig. 7C) has a broader layer II
with ahighercelldensity andlargerpyramidalcells inlIIc. Atthe
border to Te3 (Fig. 7D), layer IIIc of Te2.2 becomes more prominentwith its largepyramidal cells and layerV ismore celldense.
These cytoarchitectonic characteristics are well reflected
by the shape of the GLI profiles (Fig. 8). For example, area Te2.1
has a thin layer V which becomes broader in Te2.2.

3.4. Quantification of cytoarchitectonic differences and
similarities of auditory areas

The GLI-profiles of eight auditory areas Te1, Te2.1, 2.3, 3, TeI, TI,
STS1 and STS2 were subjected to a discriminant analysis in
orderto identifythose areas thathavea similarcytoarchitecture
or, on the contrary, are most distinct from each other. The results are presented in Fig. 9. It shows the differences in
cytoarchitecture between the areas by distances in the plot of
the discriminant analysis. Each area is represented by an ellipsoid and a set of 20 dots (2 hemispheres, 10 brains). The variance
in the localization of the dots reflects the cytoarchitectonic,
intersubject variability. Primary auditory area Te1 is clearly
separated from the other areas. Area TI forms a cluster that is
also separated from the other ones. It is relatively homogenous,
indicating that intersubject variability is low. Area TeI has an
intermediate position between TI, located close to the insula,
and the other auditory areas, laterally adjacent to TeI. Interestingly, area TeI’s cytoarchitectonic features are more similar to
those of area Te2.1 and STS1, which are located at some distance, laterally from Te1. TeI is less similar to the direct neighboring areas Te1 and TI. The cytoarchitecture of area Te2.2 is
similar to Te3; both areas are different from the STS areas.

3.5. Localization and interindividual variability

The cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps show the stereotaxic
localization and extent of the areas, and quantify their interindividual variability in standard reference space (Fig. 10). The
probabilistic maps well represent the localization of the areas
in the individual brains, and reflect the relationships of areas
with respect to sulcal landmarks.
Intersubject variability differs between the areas, but
also with respect to their localization in the brain The


temporo-insular areas, TeI and TI, are deeply buried in the
Sylvian fissure. The areas show a low degree of variance in
the analyzed ten brains. TI is the most medial area and
reaches more rostrally than TeI. The areas of the Planum
temporale showed a higher variability in the left hemisphere (Te2.1 rostral, Te2.2 caudal) as compared to the
right. In the right hemisphere only Te2.2 was highly variable in its most rostral part. The sulcal areas STS1 and
STS2 never extended on free lateral surface of the superior
and middle temporal gyrus. The variability of STS1 is
rather similar at the rostral and caudal end, whereas STS2
showed a somewhat lower variability at the rostral than at
the caudal end.
The interindividual variability in volumes of the areas
(Table 3) varied between the areas with the Te2 areas being
more variable than the temporo-insular and STS areas.
Lefteright and sex differences were not significant (p > .05).

3.6. Extent of the areas on the surface of the BigBrain

The temporo-insular and STS areas were additionally mapped in the BigBrain and areas were reconstructed on the
surface to calculate the middle areal surface, the middle
areal thickness and the areal volume (Table 4). The middle
areal surface was depicted on the BigBrain and shown in
Fig. 11.

3.7. Neighborhood relationships of areas and
localization with respect to anatomical landmarks

Areas TeI and TI cover large parts of the Planum polare,
medio-rostrally adjacent to Heschl’s gyrus (Fig. 12). The posterior part of TeI can be approximately delineated by the
Sulcus temporalis transversus primus. More anteriorly the
border is found on the most medial part of Heschl’s gyrus. Te1
is the laterally neighboring area of TeI in the posterior part,
while more rostrally, TeI borders Te3. There is no landmark
for the rostral end. Both areas do not reach the temporal pole,
and TI ends more rostrally than TeI. The medial border of TI is
always area Id1 of the insular cortex (Kurth et al., 2010), close
to the circular sulcus on the STG. TI, however, never crosses
the fundus of the circular sulcus.
The Planum temporale contains two areas, Te2.1 and
Te2.2. Te2.1 is located laterally to Heschl’s gyrus. Its approximate rostral border is formed by Heschl’s sulcus. Its caudal
end is not limited by a landmark, but is always found in the
posterior part of Heschl’s gyrus, where it is replaced by Te2.2.
This area neighbors Te1 and Te3. Te2.2 is found only in the
horizontal part of the Sylvian fissure. The position of STS1 and
STS2 in the STS is relatively stable across the coronal sections
in all ten brains. Both are separated approximately by the
fundus of the STS, and their lateral border is close to the
crown of the gyrus. The areas do not cover the lateral part of
the gyrus. STS1 is located at the upper bank of the STS,
laterally to Heschl’s gyrus, while STS2 occupies its lower bank.
Caudally both STS areas end approximately at the position
where Heschl’s gyrus ends. The rostral end is not indicated by
a landmark. STS1 does not extend to the Limen insulae,
whereas STS2 ends in the middle between the Limen insulae
and the temporal pole

rather cell sparse layer III compared to larger cells in IIIc in Te2.2 (C); Te3 has large pyramidal cells in IIIc (D).

paradigm class according to both types of inference are listed
in Table 5.
The TI area of the left hemisphere is activated by music
comprehension, drawing and passive listening. In the right
hemisphere, it is only activated by pain monitor/discrimination tasks. Beginning from TeI to Te3, the areas were mainly
activated by acoustic tasks and showed no obvious lateralization except from passive listening, which was leftlateralized in Te1, Te2.1, and Te2.2 but not in the temporoinsular and STS areas (see Supplementary Fig. S1þS2). The
STS areas differ largely between STS1 and STS2. While the left
STS1 showed activations related to figurative language and
semantic discrimination tasks, the left STS2 is activated by
tasks which involved episodic recall, the imagination of
scenes and objects, or self-control (delay discounting). These
functional differences were separately tested for the new
areas in each hemisphere and for lateralization within each
area (Supplementary Fig. S3þS4). Lateralization shown in
Table 5 was corroborated. Right area TI was activated by pain,
whereas its left counterpart was activated by drawing and
music comprehension. The area TeI showed no significant
difference between the hemispheres. A left-side preference
was found in STS1 for drawing and in STS2 for covert reading,
delay-discounting and semantic discrimination.

### 4. Discussion

The present study yielded maps of the superior temporal
gyrus/sulcus with four new cytoarchitectonic areas, providing
new insights into the cytoarchitectonic organization of an


important part of this language-related region with presumably different functionalities. Advantages of the cytoarchitectonic study are the definition of borders based on
quantitative measures, the three-dimensional nature of the
maps, the consideration of intersubject variability in localization and cytoarchitecture, as well as the analysis of potential interhemispheric and sex differences. Two of the newly
identified areas, TeI and TI, are located medially to the primary auditory cortex, close to the insular cortex. By its
cytoarchitecture and localization, TI is a temporo-insular
transition area, whereas TeI has more characteristics in
common with areas of the temporal lobe. TeI is more similar
to area Te2.1 than to TI based on its cytoarchitecture. The
other two newly defined areas, STS1 and STS2, located in the
superior temporal sulcus, are similar in their microstructure
and showed larger differences to primary and higher auditory
areas (Te1-3). All areas were delineated based on statistical
criteria and image analysis to verify the areal borders and are
represented in a standard reference brain showing their
interindividual variability and maximum probability.

4.1. Interpretation of TI areas in the context of other
maps

The two areas of the temporo-insular cortex, TeI and TI share
features with areas in former classical maps. In Brodmann’s
map (1909), the homolog area seems to be BA52, which was not
further subdivided. BA52 ends at the Limen insulae, while our
cytoarchitectonic delineation shows that the temporo-insular
region reaches more rostrally. The caudal border seems to be
comparable. Brodmann described the border to the medial area
as granular insular cortex. The present study found that TI has
a border with a dysgranular insular region, which was
confirmed by former parcellations (Kurth et al., 2010). Von
Economo und Horn (1930) divided the temporo-insular region
into two areas: the insular-like, medial TG2b and the lateral
area TG2a, which shares cytoarchitectonic features of other
temporal areas. This is in line with the cytoarchitecture and
position of TeI and TI, but both areas are ellipsoidal in shape,
which is in contrast to the rather triangular shaped region TG2
of von Economo and Horn (1930). The latter, however, was not
confirmed by later studies. The anterior end of Economo’s TG2
reaches the lateral part of the STG, whereas the new areas TI
and TeI are buried in the Sylvian fissure. Nevertheless, TG2
overlaps in large parts with the temporo-insular areas of this
study. In comparison of the present maps with the myeloarchitectonic maps of Hopf (1954), we can assume that his
areas tpari.im and tpari.l are parts of our new areas. The border
between the Regio temporalis parainsularis and separans
(Hopf, 1954) are in line with our cytoarchitectonic delineation of
TI and TeI. In the temporo-insular delineation of Galaburda and
Sanides (1980) ProA was reported to have both insular and
temporal characteristics. This is also true for the delineation of
the temporo-insular region of this study, which showed a
further subdivision into a more insular-like (TI) and a more
temporal-like area (TeI). Recent histochemical studies investigating the supratemporal plane found two areas in the
temporo-insular region (Rivier & Clarke, 1997; Wallace et al.,
2002) called AA and MA, with area AA being located more

cytoarchitectonic results the two areas run in parallel: TI is the
medial area and TeI the lateral one. This is in line with a recent
study of the human auditory cortex which found a medial and
a lateral part of area PaI in the temporo-insular region
(Fullerton & Pandya, 2007). The STS areas have no correspondence in these histochemical studies, as histochemically
defined area STA seem to correspond to Te3.

4.2. Interpretation of STS areas in comparison to other
maps

The STS came into focus of research, when functional imaging
revealed its multimodal properties (Hein & Knight, 2008).
Findings from neuroimaging revealed a functional segregation of the STS. For example, a functional imaging study
compared spoken and written speech (Wilson, Bautista,
McCarron, 2017). Spoken speech activated Heschl’s gyrus up
to the lateral surface of the STG (Te1-3 in this work), whereas
the STS region was activated in both conditions. This response
indicates linguistic processing for the STS region. The study
proposed processing of lexical nodes associated with a region
in the upper bank of the STS, and higher level taxonomic and
syntactic processing for the lower bank. These functions
correspond anatomically to areas STS1 and STS2 and are not
well reflected in the classical maps. In Brodmann’s map (1909),
BA22 (Fig. 1) covers the convexity of the STG and would
comprise both Te3 and STS1. The whole middle temporal
gyrus was labeled as BA21 (Brodmann, 1909). Von Economo


and Koskinas (1925) largely followed Brodmann’s division of
the temporal lobe (see Table 1). The myeloarchitectonic study
of Hopf (1954) showed that the STS region can be further
subdivided. His myeloarchitectonic area profunda (Fig. 1C) is a
long-stretched sulcal area that covers half of the dorsal bank
of the sulcus and may correspond to area STS1. However, Hopf
did not describe a further sulcal area, while the present study
found a second area (i.e., STS2) on the lower bank of the sulcus. The existence of this area, however, is in agreement with
findings of a tractography-based parcellation study of the
MTG. A sulcal area was found on the lower bank of the STS
reaching from the middle to the anterior part of the sulcus (Xu,
Wang, Fan, Li, Zhang et al., 2015).

4.3. Extent of the areas in the BigBrain

[The BigBrain (http://bigbrain.loris.ca) is a reference brain for](http://bigbrain.loris.ca)
microscopic data with a resolution of 20 mm isotropic. This
high spatial resolution of the BigBrain was used to calculate
and represent the areal surfaces. Reported areal surfaces refer
to the middle areal surface. The middle areal thickness was
also calculated and seems to be a good approximation for the
cortical depth (Table 4). Von Economo and Koskinas (1925)
provided cortical thicknesses in the range from 2.2 to
2.5 mm for area TA on the STG and 3.0e3.2 mm for area TE on
the MTG. The values of the middle areal thickness increased
from TI to TeI and are highest in the STS areas, but did not
reach the values mentioned for the MTG. The extent of the

areas relative to macroanatomical landmarks as Heschl’s
gyrus is the same as in the other brains. Also, the volumetric
relations between the areas are comparable, even if the middle volumes of the areas are higher than the average areal
volumes (Table 3). The difference of middle and the geometrical volumes are less than 4% and validated the reported
method.

4.4. Lateralization of the new areas

Lateralization of language processing has been reported for
Wernicke’s region. With respect to sulcal patterns, it was
found that the STS in the right hemisphere is deeper than in
the left one (Leroy, Cai, Bogart, Dubois, Coulon et al., 2015), but
no volumetric differences for the STS were reported (Ochiai,
Grimault, Scavarda, Roch, Hori et al., 2004). This agrees with
the present cytoarchitectonic study, which did not reveal
lefteright differences in areal volumes neither for the
temporo-insular nor the STS areas. It also agrees with results
from fMRI (functional magnetic resonance imaging) studies in


which both hemispheres were activated during speech processing, and lateralization was not found (Binder, Frost,
Hammeke, Bellgowan, Springer et al., 2000; Obleser, Eisner,
Kotz, 2008). The language areas were also analyzed in a
resting-state study with respect to lateralization; this study
found only a left lateralization for the posterior STS, but not
for the middle and anterior part (McAvoy, Mitra, Coalson,
d’Avossa, Keidel et al., 2016). The posterior STS was also
found to be left-lateralized in a study investigating intelligible
speech (Friederici, Kotz, Scott, Obleser, 2010). However, the
coordinates of the peaks in MNI space (y ¼ �42) of both studies
are outside the localization of STS1 and STS2. Friederici et al.
(2010) found that the anterior STS, which would correspond to
our new areas, was activated bilaterally. Although the
cytoarchitectonic study did not reveal any differences between the hemispheres, some areal functions seem to be
lateralized. Our meta-analytic functional profiling found a
left-hemispheric preference for drawing (STS1; TI), music
comprehension (TI), covert reading, delay-discounting, and
semantic discrimination (STS2) as well as dominance of the

separately depicted for the left (LH) and right hemisphere (RH).


right hemisphere for pain discrimination (TI; Supplementary
Fig. S4). These functional differences might not be necessarily reflected in volumetric differences between left- and
right hemispheric areas.

4.5. Functional interpretation of the new areas

This study showed that TI and TeI, although neighboring
areas, differ in their microstructure. TI has characteristics of
the insular cortex, whereas TeI is similar to temporal areas.
The discriminant analysis (Fig. 9) revealed that TeI is more
closely related to area Te2.1. The MPM (Fig. 12) shows that
primary area Te1 (petrol) is surrounded by secondary areas TeI
and Te2.1. Te2 has a common border on the lateral surface of
the gyrus with area Te3. This is in line with the coreebelteparabelt concept of macaques, where the primary
auditory core region is surrounded by belt areas (probably our
TeI medially and Te2.1 and Te2.2 laterally), and ends on the
lateral surface in the parabelt region (Pandya & Sanides, 1973;
Petkov, Kayser, Augath, Logothetis, 2006). The core is connected to the belt areas, and the belt areas are connected with
each other and the parabelt areas (Clarke & Morosan, 2012).
The auditory areas in macaques were compared to human
auditory areas in a study by Fullerton and Pandya (2007),
which is a hint to possibly the same information processing in
humans.
The human core to parabelt areas (Te1-3) are activated by
all tasks requiring spectro-temporal analysis of sounds


(Table 5), but the analysis for the temporo-insular region
shows different functions for TI and TeI confirming our
cytoarchitectonic results, in which TeI is more similar in its
microstructure to Te2.1 than to its neighboring area TI. TI is
activated by interoception (pain) and fine motor control
(drawing), both insular-like functions. Music comprehension
was found in both areas. The temporo-insular region is
activated by sung speech, prosody and melody (Brown,
Martinez, Parsons, 2004; Callan, Tsytsarev, Hanakawa,
Callan, Katsuhara et al., 2006; Jeffries, Fritz, Braun, 2003).
Angulo-Perkins et al. (2014) found that this region is only
activated by music, not by speech. Another study has found
abstract perception of speech on the Planum polare (Hasson,
Skipper, Nusbaum, Small, 2007). The temporo-insular region
was also activated by tasks involving melody and music
(Angulo-Perkins et al., 2014; Barrett & Hall, 2006; Brown et al.,
2004; Callan et al., 2006; Koelsch, Gunter, von Cramon,
Zysset, Lohmann et al., 2002; Patterson, Uppenkamp,
Johnsrude, Griffiths, 2002), and prosody of language
(Friederici, Meyer,von Cramon, 2000; Scott, Blank, Rosen,
Wise, 2000), which is supposed to be a major function of
this region and which can be explained by the tone/pitch
discrimination of the area TeI. These activations can be
better described by the new maps of the temporo-insular
region than by the macrolabels e anterior part of BA22 and
the posterior part of BA38.
The same is true for the segregation of the STS cortex,
where the functional profiling revealed different functional


-----

roles for the upper and lower bank. Accordingly, STS1 is
linked to figurative language, semantic discrimination and
theory-of-mind cognition, whereas STS2 is linked to episodic
recall, object/scene imagination, covert reading, and delaydiscounting. In a study by Wilson (2017), the upper bank
was activated by backward speech and may be processing
phonological word forms, whereas the lower bank showed
little to no response to backwards speech and is likely to
perform a higher level of linguistic processing. This higher
linguistic processing would require memory retrieval and
imagination of object and scenes to connect the words to
their meaning. Area STS2 was connected to precuneus,
medial frontal pole and gyrus cinguli (Bludau et al., 2014; Xu
et al., 2015), structures that are involved in working memory.
It was also found that the mid-to-anterior part of the STS was
activated by tasks requiring the processing of intelligible
speech (Clos, Langner, Meyer, Oechslin, Zilles et al., 2014;
Evans, Kyong, Rosen, Golestani, Warren et al., 2014; Kyong,
Scott, Rosen, Howe, Agnew et al., 2014; Shultz,
Vouloumanos, Pelphrey, 2012) and voice (Belin, Zatorre,
Lafaille, Ahad, Pike, 2000; Pernet, McAleer, Latinus,
Gorgolewski, Charest et al., 2015; Schall, Kiebel, Maess,von
Kriegstein, 2015). It seems that the spectro-temporal information of the auditory input is analyzed in the dorsal plane
and the lateral free surface of the STG. This region largely
corresponds to areas Te1-3. The newly described areas of the
STS however, are cytoarchitectonically and functionally
distinct from this auditory region. This notion is supported
by functional profiling (see Table 5). Thus, our new maps
seem to better reflect the activation differences found in
functional neuroimaging studies than does the unitary representation of Brodmann’s area BA22, which comprises Te3
and STS1.
For the structural/functional relationship of the areas, we
used the BrainMap database with a resolution of
2 � 2 � 2 mm[3]. Although this analysis provided sound results,
the resolution of the BrainMap database does not match the
precision of our maps due to technical constraints of fMRI.
The functional properties of small areas, especially those of
the temporo-insular region, would benefit from further investigations with ultra-high field fMRI. Thus, a more finegrained functional parcellation of these areas would be
possible in future, as it has been previously reported for the
auditory (Moerel, De Martino, Kemper, Schmitter, Vu et al.,
2018) and visual cortices (Kemper, De Martino, Emmerling,
Yacoub, Goebel, 2018).
In conclusion, the present study delineates four new
cytoarchitectonic areas, TI and TeI medial, and STS1 and
STS2 lateral, of primary and early auditory cortex. A
comprehensive map of the STG is provided. The areas of the
temporo-insular region show a dichotomy in their microstructure: area TI is more insular-like, while area TeI has
cytoarchitectonic characteristics of secondary auditory
areas, which confirms the core-belt concept of macaques in
the human brain. The STS areas are functionally and
cytoarchitectonically different from the parabelt area Te3.
Area Te3 is engaged in the spectro-temporal analysis of
auditory input, whereas the STS areas are activated during
higher language and cognitive tasks.
