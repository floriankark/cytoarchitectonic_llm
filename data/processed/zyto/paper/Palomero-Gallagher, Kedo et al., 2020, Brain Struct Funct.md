**Abstract**
The human hippocampal formation is relevant for various aspects of memory and learning, and the different hippocampal
regions are differentially affected by neuropsychiatric disorders. Therefore, the hippocampal formation has been subject of
numerous cytoarchitectonic and other mapping studies, which resulted in divergent parcellation schemes. To understand the
principles of hippocampal architecture, it is necessary to integrate different levels of hippocampal organisation, going beyond
one modality. We here applied a multimodal mapping approach combining cyto- and multi-receptorarchitectonic analyses, and
generated probabilistic maps in stereotaxic space of the identified regions. Cytoarchitecture in combination with the regional
and laminar distribution of 15 neurotransmitter receptors visualized by in vitro receptor autoradiography were analysed in
seven hemispheres from 6 unfixed shock frozen and serially sectioned brains. Cytoarchitectonic delineations for generation
of probabilistic maps were carried out on histological sections from ten fixed, paraffin embedded and serially sectioned
brains. Nine cyto- and receptorarchitectonically distinct regions were identified within the hippocampal formation (i.e., fascia
dentata, cornu Ammonis (CA) regions 1–4, prosubiculum, subiculum proper, presubiculum and parasubiculum), as well as
the hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area and the periallocortical transsubiculum. Subsequently generated probabilistic
maps quantify intersubject variability in the size and extent of these cyto- and receptorarchitectonically distinct regions. The
regions did not differ in their volume between the hemispheres and gender. Receptor mapping revealed additional subdivisions which could not be detected by cytoarchitectonic analysis alone. They correspond to parcellations previously found in
immunohistochemical and connectivity studies. The multimodal approach enabled the definition of regions not consistently
reported, e.g., CA4 region or prosubiculum. The ensuing detailed probabilistic maps of the hippocampal formation constitute
the basis for future architectonically informed analyses of in vivo neuroimaging studies.

The hippocampal formation, which comprises the hippocampus proper and the subicular complex, plays a crucial
role in the formation, organization, and retrieval of memories, and is involved in the control of mood, alertness and
attention (e.g., Sweatt 2010, McDonald and Hong 2013).

Furthermore, in humans different aspects of memory and
learning have been associated with distinct regions of the
hippocampus and/or subicular complex (Zeineh et al. 2003;
Eldridge et al. 2005; Bakker et al. 2008; Suthana et al. 2009).
Human autopsy and in vivo volumetric studies of the hippocampal formation have shown that hippocampal regions
are differentially affected by neuropsychiatric disorders
(Fukutani et al. 1995; Sousa et al. 1999; Sapolsky 2000;
Rössler et al. 2002; Lim et al. 2012). However, the results
of these studies are often inconsistent and controversial. For
example, there are differences in the criteria applied for the
definition of both the outer and inner hippocampal borders
(Konrad et al. 2009). To overcome such problems, the Hippocampal Subfields Group was formed as an international
initiative to develop a harmonized protocol for segmentation of the hippocampal formation on high-resolution MRI
(Wisse et al. 2017). Verification of regional borders as seen
in MRI by microstructural studies is crucial in this effort.
Cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of the hippocampal
formation in stereotaxic space are a tool to correlate MRI
delineations (e.g., Wisse et al. 2012; Beaujoin et al. 2018)
with cytoarchitecture. However, currently available maps
provide separate delineations for the dentate gyrus (DG),
the cornu Ammonis (CA) region and the subicular complex,
but not subdivisions of the latter two (Amunts et al. 2005).
The macro- and microscopic organization of the hippocampal formation has been comprehensively described
in multiple reviews and monographies (Duvernoy 2005;
DeFelipe et al. 2007; Nieuwenhuys et al. 2008; Insausti
and Amaral 2012). It is a convoluted gray matter structure
encompassing three architectonically distinct regions: the
fascia dentata (FD), the CA region (which can be subdivided
into the CA1–CA4 fields), and the subicular complex. This
cortical strip undergoes a complex in-folding process during
embryogenesis which results in the FD and CA (together
with the subicular complex) forming two interlocking C’s
in such a way that the FD is seen as the reversed C when
viewing the hippocampal formation in coronal sections.
The concavity formed by the FD envelops the CA4 segment of the CA region, and the combination of these two
cytoarchitectonically distinct entities forms the macroscopically identifiable DG (Zilles et al. 2015). The walls of the
hippocampal fissure, which separates the dentate gyrus
from the CA1–CA3 fields and the subiculum, becomes
partially fused during development. The hippocampal formation is located on the inferomedial aspect of the hemisphere (Fig. 1a), where it bulges into the temporal horn of
the lateral ventricle and arches around the mesencephalon.
It has been divided medio-laterally into intra- and extraventricular portions, and rostro-caudally into anterior (hippocampal head), intermediate (hippocampal body) and posterior (hippocampal tail) segments (Fig. 1b). The head is the
most voluminous portion of the hippocampus, and its most

rostro-medial part is often fused with the rostrally adjacent
amygdala. The intraventricular aspect of the head is differentiated into the digitationes hippocampi, which are visibly
macroscopically in the form of several lobules separated by
small sulci (Fig. 1b). Its lateral aspect is associated with the
caudal portion of the uncus, which results from the curling
of the parahippocampal gyrus back onto itself (Fig. 1a). The
uncal apex is occupied by the CA, and is delimited rostrally
by the superficial segment of the FD, which follows a vertical route along the uncal surface and corresponds to the
band of Giacomini (Fig. 1a). The hippocampal body is sagittally oriented, and its intraventricular part forms a smooth
and strongly convex protrusion into the floor of the lateral
ventricle. The extraventricular portion of the hippocampal
body is reduced in size, being limited to the DG and fimbria (Fig. 1a). In humans, the narrow DG segment visible
on the temporal lobe surface has a characteristic toothed
appearance, and was thus named margo denticulatus (Klingler 1948), whereby the rounded protrusions which form the
dentes of the DG decrease gradually in size when moving
caudally. The hippocampal tail occupies the posterior part
of the hippocampal arc and, as described above for the head,


-----

its intraventricular portion displays digitationes hippocampi
(Fig. 1b). The hippocampal tail has been divided into initial,
middle and terminal segments, with the first being found
adjacent to the hippocampal body, and the last located ventral to the splenium of the corpus callosum. In the anterior
segment the DG displays small dentes, but in the middle segment, the margo denticulatus becomes smooth and narrow,
and forms the fasciola cinerea, i.e., segment of DG visible
on the temporal lobe surface at the most posterior part of the
hippocampal formation (Fig. 1a). In the hippocampal tail,
CA1 appears progressively at the surface of the parahippocampal gyrus and sometimes produces rounded bulges,
i.e., the gyri of Andreas Retzius (1896), which are separated
from the fasciola cinerea by the superficial hippocampal sulcus (Fig. 1a). The terminal segment of the hippocampal tail
covers the inferior surface of the splenium and constitutes
the subsplenial gyrus.
The FD and CA are archicortical in nature, whereas the
subicular complex has been classified as periarchicortex
(Zilles 2004). The FD displays the most rudimentary laminar structure of the hippocampal formation, with a superficial molecular layer followed by a very thin and densely
packed granular layer and a thin multiform layer (Fig. 2)
which abuts the CA4 region. Although six layers may be
identified within CA (alveus, oriens, pyramidal, radiatum,
lacunosum, and molecular; Fig. 2), they are often merged
into three major layers: a broad pyramidal layer with the
cell bodies of pyramidal neurons flanked by two molecular layers. The deeper molecular layer is composed of the
oriens and alveus layers, and contains the basal dendrites and
the axon of pyramidal cells. The superficial molecular layer
encompasses the radiatum, lacunosum and molecular layers
into which the apical dendrites of the pyramids extend. In

**Fig. 2 Schematic representation of the laminar structure of the fascia**
dentate and the cornu Ammonis. Note that the lucidum layer (highlighted by an asterisk) is only present in CA3, and the CA4 region
only presents a single layer of modified pyramidal cells. Axon is indicated by curved line with an arrowhead


the CA3 region an additional layer can be identified between
the pyramidal and radiatum layers, i.e., the lucidum layer,
which is targeted by the axons of the FD granular cells.
The hippocampal formation has been subject of numerous mapping studies which have resulted in divergent parcellation schemes. Lorente de Nó (1934) identified four
regions within CA, i.e., CA1, CA2, CA3 and CA4. However, CA2 is not always accepted as a separate region, but
has been merged with CA3 by some authors (von Economo
and Koskinas 1925; Stephan 1975). CA4 is not universally
accepted as a distinct region either, and merged with the
multiform layer of FD to form the hilus of the DG (Vogt and
Vogt 1919; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Rose 1938;
Amaral and Inausti 1990). Likewise, discrepancies also exist
concerning the number of subregions which can be defined
within a given CA region. For example, whereas Lorente
de Nó (1934) identified three subfields within CA1, Vogt
and Vogt (1919) described the existence of six subfields.
The picture is similar when moving medially from the hippocampus into the subicular complex. Classical and contemporary architectonic studies brought forth different parcellation schemes, the most common of which includes the
prosubiculum (ProS), subiculum proper (Sub), presubiculum
(PreS) and parasubiculum (PaS). However, ProS and PaS are
not always accepted as individual regions (Stephan 1975;
Braak 1980; Amaral and Inausti 1990), and discrepancies
also exist concerning the number of subregions that can be
defined within a given region: e.g., two or three subdivisions
within PreS (von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Rose 1927).
A multimodal strategy combining cyto- and receptorarchitectonic analyses has proven to be a powerful mapping
tool to identify and characterize cortical areas as well as
to reveal aspects concerning their functional hierarchical
organization (Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles 2017; Zilles
and Palomero-Gallagher 2017). Such an approach has not
only enabled further confirmation of the location and extent
of cytoarchitectonically identified cortical areas, but has
also revealed further subdivisions within them (e.g., Geyer
et al. 1996; Morosan et al. 2005; Palomero-Gallagher et al.
2008; Amunts et al. 2010). In a recent study of the human
amygdala, such a multimodal approach enabled a better
characterization of the paralaminar nucleus, which presents
a molecular organization in-between that of nuclei belonging to the laterobasal and the superficial groups (Kedo et al.
2018).
The aim of the present study was twofold: (1) the multimodal definition and characterization of regions within
the hippocampal formation, with particular attention as
to whether further parcellations of the major hippocampal regions should be considered if multiple receptors are
taken into consideration. (2) Application of novel workflows for the computation of probabilistic maps to create
a revised and more detailed version of our previous map

of the hippocampal formation (Amunts et al. 2005). Thus,
whereas Amunts et al. (2005) provided delineations for the
hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (HATA), DG, CA
and the subicular complex, but not for subdivisions of the
latter two regions, the updated version resulting from the
present study provides information concerning intersubject
variability of the FD, CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, ProS, Sub,
PreS and PaS regions, and will enable future comparisons
of cytoarchitectonically informed parcellation schemes in
stereotaxic space with high resolution structural and/or functional imaging data.

### Materials and methods

#### Tissue

We examined a total of 16 human post-mortem brains
(Table 1) from subjects without a history of neurological
or psychiatric disorders and obtained via body donors in
accordance with the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of
the University of Düsseldorf. Ten of these brains (5 males;
mean age 64.9 ± 16.9 years; cases B01–B14 in Table 1)
were processed for cytoarchitectonic analysis and subsequent computation of probabilistic 3D-maps. The remaining six brains (2 females; mean age: 76.3 ± 2.5 years; cases
AR01–AR06 in Table 1) were processed for receptor autoradiographic analysis. In these latter cases, alternate sections were additionally processed for the visualization of cell
bodies to compare the receptorarchitectonic findings with


the cytoarchitecture of the hippocampal formation, i.e., the
major criteria underlying the probability maps.

#### Cytoarchitectonic analysis and probabilistic mapping

Brains were removed from the skull, fixed in formalin,
scanned with a T1-weighted magnetic resonance sequence
(3-D FLASH sequence covering the entire brain) before histological processing, then embedded in paraffin and serially
sectioned (section thickness 20 µm) in the coronal plane with
a large-scale microtome. Every 15th section was mounted
on gelatine-coated slides and stained for cell bodies with
a modified silver cell-body staining (Merker 1983). Every
60th section was mapped, and the borders of hippocampal
regions CA1, CA2, CA3, CA4, FD, ProS, Sub, PreS and PaS
were compared with the receptorarchitectonically defined
borders (see below). The multimodally defined borders were
finally traced on high resolution images of the histological
sections of the ten formalin fixed brains using in-house software. These contours were used for the computation of volumes of the individual hippocampal areas using Cavalieri’s
principle (Amunts et al. 2005) and for the 3D-reconstruction
of mapped regions.
Whole brain volume representations were 3D-reconstructed by means of linear and non-linear registration
algorithms using a modification of the workflow described
in Amunts et al. (2005) using the images of the histological sections and the structural magnetic resonance (MR)
data sets. In this improved approach, a new first step was
introduced in which high resolution images of the sections

were segmented into left and right hemispheres by means
of labelled masks, and each hemisphere was iteratively
corrected using a section-by-section elastic alignment of
adjacent sections (Mohlberg et al. 2012). The ensuing histological volumes were then registered to the brain’s MR
volume by linear and non-linear registration steps to eliminate distortions and shrinkage inevitably caused by histological techniques (Hömke 2006). Since each voxel in the
histological volumes represented 20 µm, but resolution of
the MR dataset was 1 mm, it was necessary to down-sample
the histological volume, and, in contrast to the previously
published maps of the hippocampal formation (Amunts et al.
2005), a continuous approach was chosen for this step. These
down-sampled and morphologically rectified histological
volumes together with the areal borders defined in each one
of them (also at the 20 µm resolution level) were then spatially normalized to the T1-weighted single-subject template
of the MNI (Collins et al. 1994) in anatomical MNI space
(Amunts et al. 2005) using a nonlinear elastic registration
algorithm (Henn et al. 1997; Hömke 2006). Corresponding
areas of the different subjects could thus be superimposed
in the anatomical MNI space to generate continuous probabilistic maps for each region. These maps describe for each
voxel of the reference brain how many individual brains
overlapped with their respective cytoarchitectonic region in
that particular voxel. The extent of each region in the coronal, sagittal, and horizontal axis, as well as their centres of
gravity were calculated in anatomical MNI coordinates for
each of the examined brains individually. Finally, maximum
probability maps were generated for each region by calculating for each voxel of the reference brain the highest probability to contain a given region (Eickhoff et al. 2005). The
maximum probability maps thus provide a unique estimate
of the extent and location of each region.

#### Receptor autoradiography

Brains were bisected at autopsy, hemispheres cut into
2–3 cm thick slabs, frozen in isopentane at − 40 °C and serially sectioned in the coronal plane into 20 μm thick sections
by means of a large-scale cryostat microtome. Alternating
sections were processed for visualization of 15 different neurotransmitter receptor binding sites by means of quantitative
in vitro receptor autoradiography according to previously
published standard protocols (Zilles et al. 2002; PalomeroGallagher and Zilles 2018); Table 2), or for the visualization
of cell bodies (Merker 1983). In short, a binding protocol

**Fig. 3 Successive coronal sections from brain B04 showing the ros-**
tro-caudal sequence of regions within the hippocampal formation and
their relation to macroanatomic landmarks. The distance between
sections (in µm) can be determined by calculating the differences
between two section numbers (specified in the top left corner of each
panel) and multiplying this result by 20 (the thickness of a single section). Sections 4561–3901 belong to the hippocampal head, the hippocampal body is represented by an exemplary section (3841; thick
black frame), and sections 3241–2581 are part of the hippocampal
tail, which can be further divided into initial (sections 3241–3076),
middle (sections 3001–2926) and terminal (sections 2896–2581) segments, as designated by Duvernoy (1988). Note that sections 3061–
3016 reveal features of both the initial and middle segments. Note
also, that the subicular complex is found throughout the hippocampal
head. Each cytoarchitectonic region is marked on each section by its
respective color as specified at the bottom right of the figure. _acalc_

consists of three steps: (1) a pre-incubation to re-hydrate
sections and remove endogenous ligands, (2) a main incubation to label binding sites with a tritiated ligand in the
presence (non-specific binding) or absence (total binding)
of an appropriate non-labelled displacer, and (3) a final rinsing step to stop binding and eliminate surplus radioactive
ligands. Since non-specific binding was less than 5% of total
binding in all cases, we considered the estimates of the total
binding to be equal to specific binding.
Radioactively labelled sections were co-exposed with
plastic ­[[3]H]-standards (Microscales; Amersham, Braunschweig, Germany) of known radioactivity concentrations
against tritium-sensitive films for 8–15 weeks. The ensuing autoradiographs were digitized and processed densitometrically (Zilles et al. 2002; Palomero-Gallagher and Zilles
2018). The plastic standards were used to compute a transformation curve indicating the relationship between grey
values in the autoradiograph and receptor densities (fmol/mg
protein) in the tissue. Images were subsequently linearized,
contrast enhanced, smoothed, and pseudo-colour coded in
a spectral order to optimize visualization of regional and
laminar receptor distribution patterns.

#### Multimodal border definition

Borders were first identified according to cytoarchitectonic
criteria based on previous cyto- and pigment-architectonic
studies in the hippocampus (von Economo and Koskinas
1925; Lorente de Nó 1934; Rose 1927, 1938; Braak 1978;
Rosene and Van Hoesen 1987; Duvernoy 1988; Amaral and
Inausti 1990; Amunts et al. 2005) and subicular complex
(von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Stephan 1975; Braak
1980; Amaral and Inausti 1990), then compared with those
revealed by differences in receptor distribution patterns.
Cytoarchitectonically detected borders were mirrored by
changes in the expression levels of multiple receptors. Furthermore, differences in receptor densities also enabled the
subdivision of cytoarchitectonically defined regions.
Since cytoarchitectonic probabilistic mapping requires
analysis of formalin-fixed brain tissue, while the use of
deep frozen tissue is the prerequisite for quantitative in vitro
receptor autoradiography, it is technically not possible to use
the same brains for probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping
and receptorarchitectonic studies.

#### Statistical analyses

The volumes of each hippocampal region were analysed
with respect to interhemispheric and gender differences
using Monte-Carlo permutation tests. Prior to this analysis,
all areal volumes were expressed as a fraction of total brain
volume for each brain to adjust for differences in total brain
size.


For the analysis of gender differences, we first computed
the difference in the mean volumes between male and female
subjects. Under the null-hypothesis of gender exchangeability, we then randomly reassigned each subject to one of the
two groups (male/female) and re-computed the respective
difference between the mean volumes of the ensuing randomly assembled groups. This difference obtained under the
null-hypothesis that subjects’ assignment to a gender group
was recorded, and the procedure repeated ­10[6] times. The
true gender difference was then considered significant if it
was larger than 95% of the values under random (i.e., null
hypothesis) distribution (p < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for
multiple comparisons).
In contrast to this between-subject design used to assess
gender differences, the analysis of inter-hemispheric differences used a within-subject design. In particular, we first
computed the difference between left and right regional
volume for each subject. The mean of these values represents the average inter-hemispheric difference in the ensuing
paired-test design. Under the null-hypothesis that there is no
difference between the hemispheres and that side-labels may
hence be freely exchangeable, we then randomly and independently across subjects designated the two measurements
as "left" or "right". Again, the difference between "left" and
"right" areal volume was computed for each subject, thus
providing a difference value under the null-hypothesis that
left and right values were not systematically different. This
procedure was repeated ­10[6] times and true inter-hemispheric
differences were then considered significant if it was larger
than 95% of the values under random (i.e., null hypothesis)
distribution (p < 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons).

### Results

#### Multimodal characterization of regions within the hippocampal formation

Based on cyto- and receptorarchitectonic criteria, we delineated five regions within the hippocampus (FD, CA4, CA3,
CA2, CA1) and four within the subicular complex (ProS,
Sub, PreS and PaS; Fig. 3). In addition to the borders
between these regions, in some cases we could also identify
subregions with distinct receptorarchitectonic features.
FD, located on the DG together with the CA4 region,
is the most medial of the regions defined within the hippocampus proper, although CA1 is the first one to appear
when moving from rostral to caudal (Supplementary
Table 1; Fig. 3, sections 4486 and 4081). The smaller and
less densely packed cells in the multiform layer of FD enable
its separation from CA4, where neurons show a more dense
packing (Figs. 4a, b, 5a, b). Furthermore, cell bodies tend

to form clusters in CA4, but not in the multiform layer of
the FD. The border between FD and CA4 was also clearly
revealed by differences in the densities of receptors for glutamate, GABA, acetylcholine and noradrenaline (Fig. 6). The
multiform layer contained lower AMPA, NMDA, kainate,

Furthermore, AMPA, ­GABAA, ­M1, ­M3 and α2 receptors are
heterogeneously distributed throughout the molecular layer
of the FD, with higher densities in its outer than inner portions (Fig. 6). These differences in receptor distribution patterns between FD and CA4 are also reflected in differently
shaped and sized receptor fingerprints, with that of CA4
being smaller (Fig. 7).

CA4, one of the smallest regions of the hippocampal formation (Table 3), is flanked by FD and CA3 (Fig. 3). The
cytoarchitectonic border between CA3 and CA4 is characterized by the presence of the oriens, pyramidal, lucidum, and
radiatum-lacunosum-molecular layers in CA3, but only of
the pyramidal layer in CA4 (Figs. 4b, 5b). This delineation is
further supported by differences in the densities of NMDA,
­M1 and α2 receptors, which were considerably lower in the
pyramidal layer of CA3 than in CA4 (Fig. 5). The receptor
fingerprint of CA3 is smaller than that of CA4, although they
are both quite similar in shape (Fig. 7).
CA3 is the only region in which the lucidum layer, as
clearly revealed by high kainate and α1 receptor densities
(asterisk in Fig. 6), is present. The border between CA3 and
CA2 could also be defined cytoarchitectonically by differences in the arrangement of cell bodies within the pyramidal
layer: they are homogeneously distributed in CA3, but form
a superficial, more densely packed sublayer, and a deep,
less densely packed sublayer in CA2 (Fig. 5b). The border
between CA3 and CA2 is also revealed by differences in the
densities of ­GABAA, ­GABAB, ­M1, ­M3 and 5-HT1A receptors,
as well as of ­GABAA/BZ binding sites, which were lower in
CA3 than in CA2. These differences are particularly obvious in the pyramidal layer, but are also reflected in receptor
fingerprints. The CA3 fingerprint has a more pronounced
difference in the densities of ­GABAA/BZ binding sites and
­GABAB receptors than that of CA2, which presents a clear
peak at the level of the 5-HT1A receptors (Fig. 7). The opposite holds true for 5-HT2 receptor densities (Fig. 6). Interestingly, receptor distribution patterns reveal the existence of
three subdivisions within CA3: CA3a (adjacent to CA2),
CA3b and CA3c (adjacent to CA4). Densities of NMDA,
AMPA, ­GABAB, ­M1, ­M3, and α2 receptors as well as of
­GABAA/BZ binding sites are lowest in the radiatum and
lacunosum-molecular layers of CA3a and highest in those
of CA3c (Figs. 6, 8).
CA2, also a relatively small region (Table 3), is located
between the CA1 and CA3 regions (Fig. 3). The border

between CA2 and CA1 was characterized by a narrower and
more densely packed pyramidal layer in CA2 than in CA1
(Fig. 5). This finding matches differences in the densities of
AMPA, NMDA, ­GABAA, ­M1, ­M3, α2, and 5-HT1A receptors
as well as of ­GABAA/BZ binding sites, which were higher in

the 15 receptors averaged over all layers of CA1 and CA2
(Fig. 7).
CA1 is the largest region in the hippocampal formation
(Table 3), and the first part of the cornu Ammonis to appear
when moving from rostral to caudal (Supplementary Table 1;
Fig. 3 section 4486). It is bordered medially by the subicular
complex (i.e., by its ProS region), and dorso-laterally by CA2.
The most caudal portion of CA1 is located on the Retzius gyrus,
beneath the splenium of the corpus callosum. Cytoarchitectonically, the border between CA1 and ProS is characterized by
the abrupt disappearance of the radiatum layer and the gradual
appearance of large subicular-like pyramids in the deeper portion of the pyramidal layer of ProS, as well as of a rudimentary
polymorph layer directly abutting the white matter (Figs. 4c,
5c). The border between CA1 and ProS was also highlighted
by conspicuous changes in the densities of many receptors
(Fig. 6). The pyramidal layer of ProS, even in its superficial
portion, which contains CA-like pyramids, contained lower
AMPA, NMDA, ­GABAA, ­M2, α2, and 5-HT1A receptor densities as well as ­GABAA/BZ binding sites, than that of CA1.
Additionally, the molecular layer of CA1 contained higher
nicotinic α4/α2 receptor densities than that of ProS. The most
conspicuous differences between the fingerprints of CA1 and
ProS are the pronounced 5-HT1A receptor peak in the former
region, and the reversal of the balance of ­GABAA/BZ binding
site and ­GABAB receptors in ProS (Fig. 7). Indeed, whereas in
CA1–CA4 the densities of ­GABAB receptors were higher than
those of ­GABAA/BZ binding sites, the opposite holds true for
regions of the subicular complex.


Changes in receptor distribution patterns also highlighted the existence of three subdivisions within CA1,
which were particularly obvious in the hippocampal body
(Fig. 6), though not restricted to this rostro-caudal segment
(Fig. 8): CA1a (bordering ProS), CA1b, and CA1c (adjacent
to CA2). Interestingly, these differences were pronounced in
the radiatum and lacunosum-moleculare layers, but somewhat gradual in the pyramidal layer, and were not visible
in sections processed for the visualization of cell bodies.
CA1a and CA1b could be distinguished by the higher ­M2
and 5-HT1A densities in the radiatum layer, lower α4/α2 densities in the lacunosum-molecular layer, and lower NMDA
and ­GAABAA densities in the pyramidal layer of CA1a
than in the corresponding layers of CA1b. CA1b and CA1c
differed in their NMDA, ­GABAA, α2 and 5-HT1A receptor
densities, which were higher in the pyramidal layer of the
former subregion. Additionally, the radiatum layer of CA1b
contained higher kainate, NMDA, ­GABAA ­GABAB, ­M3, α1,
α2, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor densities, as well as ­GABAA/
BZ binding site densities than that of CA1c.
The most lateral portion of the subicular complex, i.e., area
ProS (Supplementary Table 2), is characterized by the gradual
disappearance of the pyramidal cells typical of the CA region,
which in ProS form a superficial cell dense sublayer adjacent
to the molecular layer, accompanied by the gradual appearance of a deeper cell layer containing large subicular-like
pyramids (Figs. 4c, 5c). The border between ProS and Sub
was cytoarchitectonically characterized by the existence of a
typical polymorph layer and differentiation of the pyramidal
layer in the latter region (Figs. 4c, 5c): an external pyramidal sublayer, where pyramids tend to form clusters, is followed by an internal pyramidal sublayer, where they present
a radial arrangement and by a cell sparse internal sublayer
populated by polymorph neurons (sublayer i). Furthermore,
the molecular layer of Sub presented isolated clusters of presubicular layer 2 cells, which could be identified, because
they contained smaller and more densely packed pyramids
than Sub clusters. At the receptor level, differences between
ProS and Sub were mostly restricted to external sublayer
of the pyramidal layer, where densities of AMPA, NMDA,
­GABAB, 5-HT1A, and 5-HT2 receptors were higher in ProS
than in Sub (Fig. 6). Additionally, NMDA, ­GABAA, ­GABAB,
and α2 receptor densities as well as ­GABAA/BZ binding site
concentrations were higher in the molecular layer of ProS
than in that of Sub. Finally, nicotinic α4/β2 receptor densities
were consistently higher in Sub than in ProS. These differences were also reflected at the mean regional level, where
Sub presented a smaller fingerprint than ProS (Fig. 7).
Sub, the largest of the regions defined within the subicular complex (Table 3), and the first of the regions within
the hippocampal formation to appear when moving from
rostral to caudal (Fig. 3; Supplementary Tables 1 and 2), is
followed medially by PreS. The border between these two

regions is clearly visible due to the appearance in PreS of
the dissecans layer, a cell sparse layer separating the external

The external layers of PreS contain higher kainate, ­GABAA,
­GABAB, α4/β2, α1, 5-HT1A and 5-HT2 receptor densities as
well as ­GABAA/BZ binding site concentrations than do the
superficial layers of Sub (Fig. 6). Additionally, the internal

site concentrations, but lower ­M2 receptor densities in PaS
than in PreS (Fig. 8), and by a smaller receptor fingerprint
in PresS than in PaS (Fig. 7). PaS is the most external of the
regions defined within the hippocampal formation, and borders the entorhinal cortex (Fig. 3; Supplementary Table 2).
Although PaS was always found in the hippocampal head, it
only extended into the caudal portion of the hippocampal tail
in two of the examined brains (cases #7 and #13; Fig. 11).
In the remaining eight brains PaS encroached on the hippocampal body to different extents, but did not reach its tail.
PaS was replaced caudally by the transsubiculum (TrS;
Fig. 3), a periallocortical area located between PreS and
area BA35, which displays cytoarchitectonic layers typical
of both these areas. Thus, TrS has a conspicuous parvocellular layer 2, though slightly less cell dense than that of PreS.
Furthermore, the gradual decrease in width of layer 2 of TrS
was concomitant with the appearance of a more superficially
located sublayer containing small pyramids resembling
those present in isocortical layers II and III. The dissecans
layer, a hallmark of PreS, is no longer visible in TrS, and the
subicular-like pyramids present in layers 5 and 6 of PreS are
replaced by cell bodies of different shapes. Thus, the deepest layer of TrS resembles an isocortical multiform layer
VI (Fig. 5d). The superficial layers of TrS contain higher
AMPA, kainate, ­M1, ­M3, α1, α2 and 5-HT1A receptor densities but lower GABAergic, ­M2 and α4/β2 concentrations than
do those of PreS (Fig. 6).
This multimodal analysis resulted in the definition of nine
cyto- and receptorarchitectonically distinct regions (i.e.,
FD, CA4, CA3, CA2, CA1, ProS, Sub, PreS, and PaS) for
which probabilistic maps were computed. Additionally, we
could identify three subdivisions within both CA1 and CA3
(namely CA1a, CA1b, CA1c, CA3a, CA3b and CA3c) based
solely on differences in receptor densities.

#### Volumetric analysis


Probability maps revealed a lower degree of topographical
variability for CA regions than for the FD or those located
within the subicular complex (Figs. 9, 10, 11). Thus, highest


Hippocampal regions varied considerably in their relative
sizes (Table 3). CA1 was the largest of the examined regions,
with volumes ranging from 1196 mm[3] in the left hemisphere
of case #5 to 2178 mm[3] in the right hemisphere of case
#1. Conversely, TrS was the smallest region, and volumes
ranged from 63 mm[3] in the right hemisphere of case #13 to
181 mm[3] in the right hemisphere of case #3.
There were no significant interhemispheric or gender differences in the sizes of the examined hippocampal regions,
nor did the interaction between hemisphere and region reach
the level of significance.

probabilities, i.e., where a particular region was present in

of voxels in CA, in particular in the CA1 and CA3 regions.
Within the subicular complex, the greatest degree of variability was observed for PaS, whereas the largest overlap
was obtained for the Sub and TrS regions. Since this degree
of intersubject variability resulted in an overlap of the probability maps, we computed maximum probability maps for
each region (Figs. 12, 13, 14). These maps represent a contiguous, non-overlapping parcellation of the hippocampal
complex, and although they bear a close conceptual resemblance to classical brain maps, they are not a mere schematic
visualization of “typical” hippocampal regions, but reflect
the most likely region based on our sample of ten brains and
represented in each voxel of the reference space, and provide
an adequate representation of the stereotaxic location of each
region in each individual brain.

### Discussion

We here applied a multimodal mapping approach to identify
cyto- and receptorarchitectonically distinct regions within
the human hippocampal formation and subsequently applied
novel workflows for the computation of probabilistic maps
resulting in a revised and more detailed version of our previous map (Amunts et al. 2005). Ten regions were evaluated: FD, CA4, CA3, CA2 and CA1 within the hippocampus
proper, ProS, Sub, PreS, PaS and TrS within the subicular
complex. The cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps quantify
intersubject variability in the size and extent of cyto- and
receptorarchitectonically distinct regions composing the hippocampal formation and neighbouring cortex, and constitute

the basis for future architectonically informed analyses of
neuroimaging studies.
Variations in the densities of some receptor types enabled identification of subdivisions within the CA1 and CA3
regions (i.e., CA1a, CA1b, CA1c, CA3a, CA3b and CA3c).
These subdivisions were not considered when computing
probabilistic maps, because they cannot (or not reliably so)
be identified in cell body stained sections (Lorente de Nó
1934). In addition, these subdivisions are very small, and
cannot be presented in a meaningful way in standard reference space, which is limited to 1-mm spatial resolution.
The present receptorarchitectonic analysis demonstrated,
however, that these subdivisions are functionally different
on a molecular level.
Multimodal mapping has proven to be a powerful tool
in brain research, since differences in receptor densities not
only confirm the borders of cytoarchitectonically defined
areas, but also reveal subdivisions not visible in tissue processed for the visualization of cell bodies (e.g., Geyer et al.
1996, Palomero-Gallagher et al. 2008). Differences in cytoand receptorarchitecture, with their subsequent differential
responses to synaptic input, served in the present study as
the framework to define regions within the hippocampal formation. We were particularly interested in the CA2, CA3 and
CA4 regions within the hippocampus proper, as well as in
the ProS, PaS and TrS within the subicular complex, since
their existence as independent entities has been subject of
longstanding controversy:

- CA3 has often been merged with CA2, following the
scheme proposed by Stephan (1975). However, whereas
in rodents and non-human primates the proximal apical
dendrites of CA3 display large complex spines, those of
CA2 do not have such differentiations (Ramón y Cajal
1911; Lorente de Nó 1934). In the mouse brain, a number of genes, such as those coding for the Purkinje cell
protein 4, the Regulator of G-protein signaling 14, and
the striatum-enriched protein-tyrosine phosphatase, are
selectively expressed in pyramidal neurons of the CA2
region (Cembrowski et al. 2016). Furthermore, in the
macaque brain CA3 is targeted by a considerably higher
proportion of amygdalohippocampal axons than is CA2
(Wang and Barbas 2018), whereas in the rodent brain the
opposite holds true for axonal input from the supramammillary nucleus and the paraventricular nucleus of the
hypothalamus (Cui et al. 2013; Zhang and Hernandez
2013). Although the lucidum layer is not easily detectable in cell body stained sections, it can be clearly identified in Timm stained sections due to the high zinc concentrations in mossy fiber synaptic vesicles (Danscher
1981; Becker et al. 2005). Furthermore, the lucidum layer
is particularly prominent due to its extremely high kainate and α1 receptor densities. Additionally, CA3 and CA2

also differed in their densities of ­GABAA, ­GABAB, ­M1,
­M3 and 5-HT1A receptors, as well as of ­GABAA/BZ binding sites, which were lower in the former area. Additionally, 5-HT2 receptor densities were lower in CA2 than in
CA3. Taken together, these data would argue against the
merging of CA2 and CA3 into a single region.

- Amaral and Inausti (1990) described CA3 and CA4 as
a single region, although they are not only identifiable
based on the presence/absence of specific cytoarchitectonic layers, but also differed in their connectivity
patterns and densities of multiple receptor types. Thus,
whereas CA4 only has a pyramidal layer, CA3 is composed of the oriens, pyramidal, lucidum, radiatum and
lacunosum-molecular layers. The CA4 region and the
multiform layer of FD are heavily innervated by the
locus coeruleus, whereas CA3 displays only a moderately
dense plexus of dopamine-ß-hydroxylase fibres (Swan
## 1 3


son and Hartman 1975). We found the lucidum layer to
be also clearly distinguishable by its conspicuously high
kainate and α1 receptor densities, which is in accordance with previously described observations in both
human and rodent brains (Tremblay et al. 1985; Represa
et al. 1987; Zilles et al. 2002; Palomero-Gallagher et al.
2003; Zeineh et al. 2017). The border between these two
regions can also be identified based on NMDA, ­M1 and
α2 receptor densities, which were lower in the pyramidal
layer of CA3 than in CA4.

- In some studies the CA4 region was merged with the
multiform layer of FD to build a single region, namely
the hilus (Amaral 1978; West and Gundersen 1990;
Frahm and Zilles 1994). However, CA4 and the multiform layer differ in their connectivity patterns, since the
raphe nuclei project heavily to the multiform layer of
FD, but only moderately to the CA4 region (Moore and


-----

Halaris 1975). Our results provide further support for
the concept of CA4 as being a separate region, since it
contained higher AMPA, NMDA, ­GABAB, ­M1 and ­M3
receptor densities and higher ­GABAA/BZ binding site
concentrations, but lower α1 receptor densities than did
the multiform layer of FD.

- The existence of ProS has been a subject of particular
debate. Whereas some authors define it as a distinct subfield of the subicular complex (Rose 1927; Rosene and
Van Hoesen 1987; Ding 2013), others (von Economo
and Koskinas 1925; Stephan 1975; Braak 1980; Insausti
and Amaral 2012) include the superficial layers of ProS
in the CA1 region, and the deeper ones in the Sub, since
they consider ProS to be a mere transition zone resulting from the overlap of elements from the hippocampus
proper and the subicular complex. However, the gradual
disappearance of CA-like pyramids and concomitant
appearance of subicular-like pyramids in the pyramidal
layer of ProS is not the only criterion by which the existence and extent of this region can be defined. Rather, the
borders of ProS can also be identified by abrupt changes
in lamination pattern, in the expression levels of diverse
molecular and chemical markers, as well as by specific
connectivity patterns. Cytoarchitectonically, the border between ProS and CA1 can be characterized by the
abrupt disappearance of the radiatum layer in the former
region. SMI-32 immunoreactivity in ProS is lower than
in Sub, but higher than in CA1, and acetylcholinesterase
staining is considerably higher in ProS than in either of
the two neighbouring regions (Ding 2013). Furthermore,
ProS presents higher expression levels of the neurotensin and tyrosine hydroxylase genes than do CA1 or Sub
(Ding 2013). Region and layer-specific expression levels of the htr2a gene also enable the delineation of ProS
(Ding 2013), and were comparable to those we found for
the 5-HT2 receptor as labelled with ­[[3]H]ketanserin, an
antagonist which primarily targets the 5-HT2A subtype
(Yadav et al. 2011). Our results concerning the remaining examined receptor types would also argue against
the definition of ProS as a transition region, since it differed considerably in its receptor expression levels from
both adjoining regions. Finally, the CA1, ProS and Sub
regions also differ in their amygdalohippocampal connectivity patterns, with the highest density of terminal
projections found in ProS and the lowest in Sub (Ding
2013; Wang and Barbas 2018). Whereas ProS projects to
the perirhinal cortex, CA1 and Sub do so to the entorhinal cortex (Blatt and Rosene 1998).

- PaS and TrS were initially described as being transition regions between PreS and the entorhinal cortex,
and between PreS and area BA35, respectively (Braak
1978, 1980; Braak and Braak 1993). However, PreS, PaS
and TrS show different patterns of Alzheimer-related


extracellular amyloid and intraneuronal neurofibrillary
changes (Kalus et al. 1989), and we here found marked
differences in receptor expression levels in PaS and TrS
with respect to PreS. Therefore, we here classify them
as distinct architectonic entities and not mere transition
regions.

The densities of some receptors presented a heterogeneous distribution along the transverse axis of the CA1 and
CA3 regions, thus revealing proximodistal differences which
enabled the definition of three subfields within both CA1
and CA3. These subfields were not included in the delineations used to create probabilistic maps of the hippocampus,
since the borders between them are not sharp or visible in
cell-body stained sections (Lorente de Nó 1934), and it is
technically not possible to use the same brains for probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping and receptorarchitectonic
studies. Whereas cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps are
based on the analysis of sections obtained from entire formalin-fixed and serially sectioned brains, quantitative in vitro
receptor autoradiography, which reveals the binding sites of
functional receptors located in the cell membrane, requires
use of unfixed, frozen brain tissue (Palomero-Gallagher and
Zilles 2018). Lorente de Nó (1934) identified three subdivisions within both CA1 and CA3 based on differences in
dendritic arborisation and connectivity patterns. He also
specified that the borders between subfields were not sharp
and could not be identified in cell-body stained sections, and
this was also reflected in the changes observed here concerning receptor densities, since they were only gradual in
the pyramidal layer, which encompasses the cell bodies of
pyramidal neurons, and most obvious in the radiatum and
lacunosum-molecular layers, where the apical dendrites of
CA-pyramids are found.
The “homeostasis” of receptors in a given area, i.e.,
the balance between the densities of multiple receptors in
that area, and not the mere presence or absence of a single
receptor type, represents the molecular basis of the functionally specific local information processing in that particular
area (Zilles et al. 2002; Bucher and Goaillard 2011; Maccaferri 2011). The hippocampal formation is characterized
by a heterogeneous regional and laminar cyto- and receptorarchitecture which is tightly associated with segregated
input, output and intrinsic fibre systems. Furthermore, the
different hippocampal regions and/or layers are differentially involved in diverse aspects of memory formation and
retrieval processes (Hunsaker et al. 2008; Ji and Maren
2008; Bartsch et al. 2011; Coras et al. 2014; Ledergerber
and Moser 2017; Roy et al. 2017), and display a selective
vulnerability to disease (Thal et al. 2000; Braak et al. 2006;
Kerchner et al. 2012; Reyes-Garcia et al. 2018), as well as
differential responses to pharmacological interventions and
to endogenous substances (Lynch and Bliss 1986; Sato and

## 1 3


-----

Aoki 1997; Sato et al. 1997; Yamada et al. 2003; Kobayashi
et al. 2004; Knox et al. 2011; Trieu et al. 2015). However,
the exact mechanisms by which the specific molecular structure and wiring pattern of a hippocampal region underpins
its functionality remain elusive. Furthermore, most of the
studies have been carried out in rodents, and comparably
detailed analyses in humans are restricted to cases of patients
with focal lesions, or recordings obtained during presurgical
evaluation of candidates for epilepsy surgery. Furthermore,
possible pathology-related changes in functional connectivity may not be excluded, and despite advances in the field
of high-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging,
subregions within the hippocampus and the subicular complex remain largely undistinguishable with current in vivo
human imaging methods. Interestingly, it is known that
mouse models have a poor predictive power for drug efficacy in human neurodegenerative diseases (Dawson et al.
2018). Indeed, distinct and species-specific responses of a
hippocampal region to a specific drug or endogenous substance are to be expected, since the receptorarchitecture of
the rodent hippocampus differs considerably from that of the
human hippocampus. For example, α1 and 5-HT2 receptor
densities are homogeneously distributed throughout the rat
hippocampus (Topic et al. 2007), but in humans they are
considerably higher in DG than in CA (Fig. 6); in the rat
brain 5-HT1A receptor densities are higher in DG than in
CA (Topic et al. 2007), whereas the opposite holds true for
the human hippocampus (Fig. 6). Thus, the present comprehensive characterization of the molecular organisation of the
human hippocampus proper and subicular complex provides
valuable standard measures not only for future comparisons
with tissue from patients to deepen our understanding of the
pathogenesis of neurological and psychiatric diseases, but
also for translational neuroscience strategies in the field of
drug development.
Concluding, we here provide probabilistic maps in stereotaxic space of ten cyto- and receptorarchitectonically distinct
regions within the human hippocampal formation which go
beyond previously published ones (Amunts et al. 2005). The
present maps constitute a valuable tool for future studies
involving architectonically informed structural analyses of
neuroimaging in vivo datasets, or aiming to understand the
differential roles of each hippocampal and subicular region
in learning and memory processes. Furthermore, the characterization of the regional and laminar distribution patterns of
multiple neurotransmitter receptors elucidates the molecular
organisation of the hippocampal complex and provides a
gold standard relevant for both basic research and translational neuroscience strategies.
