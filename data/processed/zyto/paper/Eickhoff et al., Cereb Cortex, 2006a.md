# The Human Parietal Operculum. I. Cytoarchitectonic Mapping of Subdivisions

The human secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) is located on the
parietal operculum, as shown by intraoperative stimulation and
functional imaging studies. The position and extent of the
anatomical correlates of this functionally defined region, however,
are still unknown. We have therefore histologically mapped the
putative anatomical correlates of the SII cortex in cell-body-stained
histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains using
quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis. The gray level index (GLI),
which is an indicator of the volume fraction of nerve cell bodies,
was measured in the parietal operculum. GLI profiles as measures
of the laminar pattern of the cortex were extracted perpendicular to
cortical layers. Cytoarchitectonic borders were detected observerindependently by multivariate statistical analysis of the laminar
profiles. Four cytoarchitectonic areas (termed OP 1--4) were
identified. This cytoarchitectonic heterogeneity of the parietal
operculum corresponds to results of functional imaging studies on
the human SII cortex and data from non-human primates where
multiple subregions within SII have been demonstrated by electrophysiological and connectivity studies.

Introduction


The concept of a secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) was
introduced for the first time to describe a second cortical
representation of the cat’s feet next to the previously defined
‘first’ somatosensory area (Adrian, 1940). Homologous regions
were also found in other mammals, including non-human
primates (Burton, 1986). The first evidence for a human SII
homologue was based on somatosensory sensations following
electrical stimulation during neurosurgery in the region of the
Sylvian fissure (Penfield and Jasper, 1954). Woolsey et al. (1979)
confirmed these results using electrical stimulation and evoked
potentials. In functional imaging studies, activations of SII have
been reported for many experimental conditions, such as light
touch (Ledberg et al., 1995; Disbrow et al., 2000), pain
perception (Coghill et al., 1994; Peyron et al., 1999), visceral
sensations (Lotze et al., 2001; Aziz et al., 2000) and tactile
attention (Burton and Sinclair, 2000; Lam et al., 2001). These
activations, however, were distributed widely over the parietal
operculum, ranging from a region at the level of the anterior
commisure (Peyron et al., 1999) to the retroinsular region (Xu
et al., 1997).
Evidence has been provided that the SII region of the
macaque monkey can be subdivided into at least two parts
(Fig. 1). Both subareas contain a separate complete body
representation and can be distinguished from each other by
their architecture and connectivity (Burton et al 1995;


Krubitzer et al., 1995). An analogous subdivision of the human
SII cortex was subsequently proposed by Disbrow et al. (2000)
based on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data.
The microstructural anatomical correlates of the human SII
region, however, have not yet been identified. The classical
brain maps of Brodmann (1909), Vogt and Vogt (1919) and von
Economo and Koskinas (1925), for example, differ greatly
between each other in their nomenclature as well as in the
number and location of candidate areas (Fig. 2, cf. Zilles, 2004).
Brodmann’s areas 40 and 43 both extend onto the parietal
operculum and are therefore by their topography candidates for
SII (Fig. 2). The opercular part of von Economo’s and Koskinas’
(1925) inferior parietal area PF (termed PFop) corresponds to
parts of BA 40. The location of their subcentral area PF D
corresponds roughly to the location of Brodmann’s area (BA) 43.
Thus PFop and PF D may be anatomical substrates for SII in the
map of von Economo and Koskinas. On the basis of their
myeloarchitectonic studies, Vogt and Vogt (1919) defined
a subcentral area 72. In contrast to BA 43 or PF D, this area
barely reaches the anterior part of the subcentral cortex rostral
to the central sulcus. Their area 88 (located on the inferior
supramarginal gyrus) may correspond to parts of area PFop.
Additionally, Vogt and Vogt (1919) defined two areas in the
depth of the Sylvian fissure, areas 73 (rostrally) and 74
(caudally), which have no homologues in the maps of Brodmann
(1909) and von Economo and Koskinas (1925). It must be
emphasized that the classical architectonic maps relied purely
on visual inspection of histological sections. The criteria for the
definition of cytoarchitectonic borders thus depended considerably on the observers experience. Differences between the
criteria used by the authors and the biological variability
between the examined brains, in particular given the small
sample sizes of these classical brain mapping studies, presumably influenced the results of former architectonic approaches. This may have led to the differences in the available
maps above described. In addition, all these maps represent
schematic two-dimensional drawings without information
about stereotaxic location and intersubject variability. They
also rarely provide information about the cortical areas within
the sulci, but show schematic projections onto the cortical
surface. The larger portion of cortical areas is thus not shown,
since the proportion of cortical surface hidden in sulci reaches
two-thirds of the total surface (Zilles et al., 1988). The
functionally defined human SII region is hidden almost entirely
in the Sylvian fissure, which makes its interpretation with
respect to the classical maps almost impossible.
The aim of the present study was therefore, to analyze the
cytoarchitecture of the parietal operculum (i.e. the region of SII)
in serial histological sections of 10 human post-mortem brains

observer-independent detection of borders between cortical
areas (Schleicher et al., 2000). The results of this mapping study
will then be described in standard stereotaxic space and
compared with the location of the human SII cortex as described
in functional imaging (Eickhoff et al., 2005).

Material and Methods


Ten post-mortem human brains (five male; Table 1) were obtained from
the body donor program of the Anatomical Institute of the University of
Du¨ sseldorf. Subjects had no clinical history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. Handedness of the subjects was unknown. Considering
a general incidence of 90% for right-handedness (Annett, 1973), it can
be assumed that most cases were right handed. The brains were
removed from the skull [<]24 h post mortem and fixed for ~6 months.
The whole brains were embedded in paraffin and serially sectioned in
a coronal plane (thickness = 20 lm). Each 15th section was stained for
cell-bodies using a silver staining method (Merker, 1983). This method
yields a higher contrast between black cell bodies and unstained
neuropil as compared with traditional Nissl-staining. This contrast is
an important prerequisite for automated cytoarchitectonic analysis.
Every 4th stained section, i.e. every 60th of the whole series, was
analyzed, resulting in a distance of 1.2 mm between examined sections.

Observer Independent Detection of Cortical Borders
Cortical borders were identified using the approach of Schleicher et al.
(2000). In short, rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) were defined in
both hemispheres of the histological sections (Fig. 3B). The ROIs were
digitized in a meander-like sequence using a microscope with a motor
stage for automated scanning and focusing (Fig. 3C). Images were
processed using the KS 400 image analyzing software (Version 3.0,
Zeiss/Germany). The gray level index (GLI; Schleicher and Zilles, 1990),
estimating the volume fraction of cell bodies (Wree et al., 1982), was
measured by adaptive thresholding in continuously adjoining square
measuring fields (32 3 32 lm). The resulting GLI image represents in
each pixel the local volume fraction of cell bodies in the corresponding
measuring field (Fig. 3D). Equidistant intensity profiles (thickness = 125
lm, spacing = 200 lm; Fig. 3E), which quantify the laminar GLI changes
from the border between layers I and II to the border between layer VI
and the white matter, were automatically obtained from the GLI images
perpendicular to the cortical layers using a minimum length algorithm.
Profiles were length normalized in order to compensate for local and
individual variations in absolute cortical thickness. The shape of each
profile was quantified by a vector of 10 features based on central
moments (mean GLI, mean x, SD, skewness and kurtosis, as well as the
analogous parameters from the absolute values of its first derivative)
(Amunts et al., 2000; Dixon et al., 1988; Zilles et al., 2002). Differences
between the feature vectors indicate differences in the shape of the
profiles, i.e. in cytoarchitecture. They were measured using the
Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis et al., 1949; Schleicher et al.,
2000). The observer-independent definition of cortical areas is based
on the hypothesis that profiles sampled from the same area are similar in
shape, resulting in small Mahalanobis distances between their feature
vectors. Profiles sampled from different areas differ in shape, resulting in
high Mahalanobis distances at their border. To increase the signal

to-noise ratio, distances were calculated between feature vectors from
blocks of b (10 [<] b [<] 40) adjacent profiles, instead of individual profiles.
They were analyzed as a function of the profile number of the border
between the blocks (Fig. 3F). The resulting distance function revealed
maxima at those positions where the regions covered by the two blocks
showed the most different laminar patterns. The significance of these
maxima was evaluated by a Hotelling’s T [2]-test with Bonferroni-correction for multiple comparisons (Fig. 3G). The position of a significant
maximum was interpreted as a cortical border, if no higher maximum
was found within one block size at either side and the maximum could
be reproduced at comparable positions in adjacent sections. These
criteria in combination with the use of the Mahalanobis distance
function and the applied test for significance allowed to discharge
minor variations in cytoarchitecture, corresponding to cortical microcolumns or more gradual cytoarchitectonic changes associated with
within-area somatotopy, thus revealing only borders between different
cortical areas. Using this approach, four different cytoarchitectonic
areas have been identified on the parietal operculum. These areas were
well distinguishable from the adjacent insular and parietal cortices as
shown in Figure 3E. The results of the observer-independent approach
were subsequently confirmed by a visual comparison of these quantitative results with the histological sections.

Interhemispheric, Interareal and Interindividual Differences
For each brain and area, 50--60 profiles (25--30 per hemisphere) were
sampled for further statistical analysis throughout its whole extent (4-10 consecutive sections). Sampled regions were free of histological
artifacts and showed a perpendicular orientation of the sectioning plane
to the cortical surface. Interhemispheric differences in the shape of the
profiles were analyzed using a Monte-Carlo analysis, which tests the
differences between the left and right hemispheric profiles against
differences between profiles selected randomly from the whole sample.
Since this analysis did not show any significant (P [>] 0.05) interhemispheric differences (cf. Fig. 4), profiles of both hemispheres were
merged.
Forty mean feature vectors (10 brains, four areas) were calculated, to
quantify the individual areal-specific cytoarchitecture. Interareal differences were tested for significance by multivariate one-way repeated
measurements analysis of variance (ANOVA; factor: area, blocking factor:
subject). The architectonic dissimilarity between the defined areas was
visualized by a canonical scatter plot using the first two canonical
variables. The degree of dissimilarity between two areas was quantified
by the mean Euclidean distance (ED) between their feature vectors
(Amunts et al., 2000; Schleicher et al., 2000), which, in contrast to the
Mahalanobis distance, quantifies the ‘true’ distance between the
centroids of two multi-dimensional groups without taking into account
their variance. The mean ED between corresponding (same) areas of
different brains was used to quantify the intersubject variability (high
distances indicated a high degree of dissimilarity, i.e. variability). The
interindividual differences were subsequently compared with the interareal distances using Student’s t-test (Bonferroni-corrected for multiple
comparisons).

Results


Area OP 1 (Fig. 5A; cf. Fig. 6)
Layer II of OP 1 was poorly separated from layer III, since its
granular cells intermingled with the small pyramidal cells of
upper layer III Layer III showed a subdivision into three


Four cortical areas were defined by observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic mapping, each of which shows a distinct
cytoarchitecture. In order to avoid premature speculations
about putative functions, we propose a neutral nomenclature
for the defined areas. It consists of two parts: OP (for
operculum) and a number depending on the caudal to rostral
sequence, i.e., OP 1 designates the most caudal area and OP 4
the most rostral.

sublayers defined by an increasing size of pyramidal cells. The
inner granular layer IV was well separated from the adjacent
pyramidal layers (III and V). Layer V contained loosely scattered,
medium-sized pyramidal cells. Layer VI contained large cells and
appeared slightly more cell-dense than layer V. The cells of
layers III--VI were frequently arranged in widely spaced columns
reaching into the underlying white matter, which renders the
cortex--white matter border less distinct


The laminar pattern was quantified by the corresponding GLI
profile: the GLI peak at the layer II/III border was broad,
reflecting the smooth transition between these layers. The
numerous large pyramidal cells in deep layer III caused an
increase in the GLI curve and separated it from the more cellsparse middle parts of layer III. The absolute GLI maximum was
found in the cell-dense layer IV. The GLI decreased throughout
layer V without any detectable sublamination and increased

again in layer VI, reflecting its numerous large cells. Finally,
a gradual decrease towards the white matter was observed.

Area OP 2 (Fig. 5B; cf. Figs 6A and 8A)
The granular cells of layer II intermingled to such a degree with
the small pyramidal cells of layer III, that both layers could not
be separated from each other. A pronounced increase in size
and density of pyramidal cells throughout layer III as noted in
OP 1 was not observed, although a few larger pyramidal cells
have been found in deep layer III. The horizontal lamination was
more distinct than in OP 1 due to the high cell density in layer
IV. Layer V contented mainly small pyramidal cells. Compared
with OP 1, OP 2 had thinner infragranular layers and a more
sharply defined white matter border.
Since only small pyramidal cells were found in lower layer III,
the GLI did not increase at this cortical depth as seen in OP 1.
A distinct peak of the GLI profile in layer IV reflected its higher
volume fractions of cell bodies as compared with layers III and
V. The rapid decrease of the GLI towards the white matter
corresponded to the sharp cortex--white matter border.

distinct separation of layers III and V from layer IV in OP 4 compared with OP1. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale bar 5 1 mm.


Area OP 3 (Fig. 7A; cf. Fig. 8)
The border of layer II to the cell-sparse layer III was blurred.
Layer III showed a low cell packing density and contained only
very few large cells. Layer IV and the infragranular layers, which
showed a low overall cell packing density, were thin. Layer VI
was only slightly more cell-dense than layer V, which contained
only very few small pyramidal cells. The white matter border
was sharp.
The average GLI was lower than in OP 2 (Fig. 8A). The GLI
peaks in layer II, IV and VI did not reach such values as in the
other opercular areas. In particular, the difference in the GLI
between layers V and VI was less pronounced than in OP 4. The
distinct border to the white matter was reflected by the sharp
decrease in GLI the end of the profile.

Area OP 4 (Fig. 7 B; cf. Figs 6 B and 8 B)
The border between layers II and upper layer III, which
contained numerous small pyramidal cells, was inconspicuous.
The middle part of layer III was sparse of cells, whereas deep
layer III contained many medium-sized pyramidal cells. Layer IV
had a moderate cell packing density and was poorly separated
from the adjacent pyramidal cell layers. The upper part of layer
V contained medium-sized pyramidal cells defining a cell-dense
sublayer, which has not been found in any other parietal
opercular area In contrast the lower sublayer of layer V was


rather sparse of cells. The transition between layer VI and the
white matter was blurred.
The GLI decreased at the border between layer II and III,
which reflected the low packing density of cell bodies in the
latter layer. The GLI showed a local minimum in the cell-sparse
layer IIIb whereas the numerous large pyramidal cells in IIIc
caused an increase in the GLI. The absolute maximum of the GLI
profile coincided with the cell-dense layer IV. The subdivision of
layer V was reflected by a higher GLI in the cell-dense upper
sublayer Va as compared with the more cell-sparse lower
sublayer Vb.

Location of OP 1--4 with Respect to Macroanatomical
Landmarks
Areas OP 1 (caudally) and OP 4 (rostrally) were located more
superficially on the parietal operculum than OP 2 (caudally) and
OP 3 (rostrally) (Fig. 9). The border between the superficial and
the deep areas was located more medial on the posterior
parietal operculum (between OP 1 and OP 2) than on its
anterior part (between OP 3 and OP 4). As a consequence, OP 3
had a common border with OP 1 in all hemispheres (section 7 in
Fig. 9A). OP 1 reached the free surface of the supramarginal
gyrus in 16 of the 20 hemispheres, although in five of these
hemispheres the dorsal border of OP 1 was located close
to the Sylvian fissure OP 4 was found on the free surface

OP 4 shows fine cell columns, large infragranular layers and a blurred transition of layer VI
into the white matter. Medium-sized pyramidal cells in lower layer III and upper layer V form a distinct sublamination of these layers. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale
bar 5 1 mm. The mean (and SD across profiles) of the GLI profiles sampled from exactly the cortex shown in the microphotograph (n 5 8--9 profiles) is shown to the right of the

(posterior subcentral gyrus) in all hemispheres. Its most dorsal
extent was usually (18 of 20 hemispheres) several millimeters
apart from the Sylvian fissure. The border between OP 1 and OP
4 was located close to the posterior subcentral sulcus, although
both areas could be found on either side of this sulcus. OP 2 and
OP 3 were located completely within the Sylvian fissure.
Whereas OP 3 sometimes occupied up to three-quarter of the
parietal operculum, OP 2 was exclusively located in the depth of
the Sylvian fissure. Both OP 2 and OP 3 reached the insular lobe
in all 20 hemispheres and cover at maximum its upper third.
OP 4 was the most rostral area in 19 hemispheres. It usually
extended approximately to the level of the lateral end of the
central sulcus but never reached the precentral part of the
subcentral gyrus. This makes the central sulcus a good landmark
for the anterior extent of OP 4. OP 1 was the most caudal area in
17 of the 20 hemispheres. OP 1 and OP 2 always extended into
the retroinsular region but never reached the caudal end of the
Sylvian fissure. Although there was no precise macroscopical
landmark for the posterior end these areas a small gyrus located


in the deeper half of the parietal operculum provided a good
estimate: In 15 out of the 16 hemispheres where this gyrus was
present it was at least partially occupied by OP 1 and/or OP 2
(cf. section 10 in Fig. 9A).

Location of OP 1--4 with Respect to Surrounding
Cortical Areas
The cytoarchitectonic areas surrounding OP 1--4 are described
in clockwise manner (cf. Fig. 9C ): The cortex located on the
precentral (frontal) part of the subcentral gyrus showed clear
cytoarchitectonic differences to OP 4. In the anterior subcentral
cortex a sublamination of layer V was not found but large
pyramidal cells were distributed evenly throughout the whole
layer V. The cell density within layer III was considerably lower
than in OP 4 (Fig. 10A). The extent and possible subparcellations of this region were not examined in this study, since
the focus of this examination was on the parietal operculum,
whose anterior end is macroscopically defined by level of the
central sulcus

Figure 8. (A) Transition from OP 2 to OP 3 (brain 5, section 3946). The border was identified by a significant maximum of the Mahalanobis distance (A1) at profile position 84. The
corresponding microphotograph is displayed in (A2). Note the more perspicuous expression of layers II, IV and VI and the higher overall cell density in OP 2. (B) Border between OP 3
and OP 4 (brain 10, section 4041). The location of the significant maximum (P \ 0.05) of the distance function at profile position 45 (B1) matches the change in cytoarchitecture
(B2). In OP 4, the cortex is thicker and more cell-dense, while the white matter border is less distinct. Prominent pyramidal cells in upper layer V and lower layer III appear area OP 4,
forming a distinct sublamination of these layers. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale bar 5 1 mm.


A common border between OP 4 and the primary somatosensory cortex was observed in 17/20 hemispheres. In detail,
area 3a bordered OP 4 in two hemispheres, 3b in 10 hemispheres and BA 2 in seven hemispheres. The most consistent
border, which was observed in all 17 hemispheres where OP 4
did neighbor the anterior parietal areas, was the border between
OP 4 and area 1. This border was also the most extensive one,
whereas the borders between OP 4 and areas 3a, 3b and 2 were
usually only observed in very few consecutive sections. Area 1
can be differentiated from OP 4 by its large elongated pyramidal
cells in layer lower layer III, its higher cell density and the very
pronounced columnar arrangement of its nerve cells (Fig. 10B;
cf. figures and descriptions in Geyer et al., 1999). The relative
thickness of the infragranular layers was smaller in BA 1 than in
OP 4. Further caudally OP 1 bordered area 1 in just a single case.
A common border between OP 1 and area 2 was only found in
the hemisphere where we also observed a border between OP 1
and area 1 and in two additional hemispheres. In all of those
hemispheres, OP 4 did also border area 1.
Thus most of the dorsal border of OP 1 was formed by the
inferior parietal cortex (IPC), which showed smaller, less
prominent pyramidal cells in sublamina IIIc and thinner
infragranular layers than OP 1 (Fig. 11A).
The cortex caudal to OP 2 was occupied by a retroinsular area
(Ri), whose cytoarchitecture was a ‘mixture’ of features from
the IPC and OP 2: the border between OP 2 and the retroinsular
cortex was marked by a decrease of cell density in layers IV and
VI, a blurring of the white matter border in the retroinsular
cortex and appearance of medium sized pyramidal cells in lower


layer III, which were not present in OP 2 (Fig. 11B). Ventrally
OP 2 and OP 3 bordered the granular insular cortex (Ig). This
border was characterized by a considerable increase in cortical
thickness especially in the subgranular layers and a decrease in
the overall cell density. The insular cortex further contained
bigger, more prominent pyramidal cells and a less distinct white
matter border (Fig. 12).

Interhemispheric, Interareal and Interindividual
Cytoarchitectonic Differences
Representative samples of profiles for OP 1--4 were analyzed. No
significant cytoarchitectonic differences between the left and
right hemispheric samples were found for any area. Thus
samples from both hemispheres were merged and 40 mean
feature vectors (10 brains, 4 areas) were calculated. The subsequent MANOVA showed that the feature vectors representing
areas OP 1--4 differed significantly from each other (P < 0.05).
In a next step the average interareal distances representing
the differences in cytoarchitecture between OP 1--4 were
compared with the interindividual variability of these areas,
i.e. the average distance between homologous areas in different
brains. The cytoarchitectonic dissimilarities between the different areas (interareal distances) were significantly higher than
their interindividual differences for all areas (P < 0.05; Fig. 13).
Moreover, the interareal distances between OP 1--4 reflected
the qualitatively described dissimilarities very well: on visual
examination, the most striking cytoarchitectonic differences
were found between the superficial areas OP 1 and OP 4 and the

more deeply located OP 2 and OP 3. The corresponding
interareal distances were correspondingly high (e.g. ED = 1.39
between OP 1 and OP 2; cf. Fig. 6A). The cytoarchitectonic
differences were less pronounced between OP 2 and OP 3 or
between OP 1 and OP 4 (Fig. 6B and 8A). This is in good
accordance to the lower interareal distances differences between these areas (ED OP 2/OP 3 = 0.75, ED OP 1/OP
4 = 0.56; Fig. 13). Importantly, since this analysis was based on
the average laminar patterns of each area as calculated from line
profiles sampled across its whole extent these results by no
means depend on the location of the different borders relative
to the plane of sectioning (which can not be ruled out entirely
for the observer-independent mapping algorithm per se) but do
reflect genuine differences and similarities in cytoarchitecture.
The obtained results were visualized in a canonical scatter
plot, where the distances between the symbols reflect the
dissimilarity in the shape of the corresponding GLI profiles (Fig.
14). In spite of a considerable interindividual variability, the
differences in the profile shapes between the four cortical areas
caused the formation of four distinct clusters (OP 1--4). These
clusters were separated without any overlap of the 95%
confidence areas of each group’s centroid.

Discussion


The present study reports four distinct architectonic areas on
the human parietal operculum (OP 1--4) which were identified


using classical cytoarchitectonic criteria and quantitative
cytoarchitectonic analysis. The application of a statistical approach for the detection of areal borders and the quantification
of cytoarchitectonic variability in the present study represent
an important difference from the classical cytoarchitectonic
examinations (e.g. Brodmann, 1909; Sarkissov et al., 1949; von
Economo and Koskinas, 1925), which relied purely on visual
inspection of histological sections and thus the individual
experience of the observer.
With respect to their topography, OP 4 and possibly OP 3
correspond approximately to Brodmann’s BA 43. In Brodmann’s
map, however, BA 43 covers the whole subcentral gyrus
(Brodmann, 1909), whereas we described a clearly different
cytoarchitecture on the precentral part of this gyrus. BA 40
extends from the intraparietal sulcus to the insular cortex and
covers also the parietal operculum. Its border to BA 43 is located
approximately at the posterior subcentral sulcus and coincides
thus with the location of the border between OP 4 and OP 1.
Therefore areas OP 1 (and OP 2) seem to be included among
other inferior parietal regions in Brodmann’s definition of BA 40.
Later researchers (von Economo and Koskinas, 1925;
Sarkissov et al., 1949) found architectonic differences between
the inferior parietal cortex and the adjacent operculum (PF
versus PFop; area 40 versus area 40op), which we could confirm
by showing significant cytoarchitectonic differences between
the IPC and OP 1. Subparcellations within the parietal operculum however which may correspond to OP 2 or OP 3 were

7, section 4276). The location of the significant (P \ 0.05) maximum (A1) is indicated in the microphotograph (A2). Layer V of OP 4 can be subdivided in a more cell-dense Va and
a cell-sparse Vb. This sublamination cannot be found in the more anterior subcentral cortex, where pyramidal cells are scattered throughout the whole layer V. The volume fraction
of cell bodies of layers III is lower than in OP 4. (B) Border between OP 4 and area 1 of the primary somatosensory cortex, (brain 1, section 4186). The location of the significant
maximum (P \ 0.05) of the distance function at profile position 60 (B1) matches the change in cytoarchitecture (B2). In OP 4, the large and elongated lower layer III pyramids which
are characteristic of area 1 (Geyer et al., 1999) discontinue. The overall cell density in OP 4 is lower, the very pronounced columnar arrangement of cells in area 1 is less evident and
a subdivision of lamina V into a cell-dense upper and a cell-sparse lower part emerges. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale bar 5 1 mm.


not described in these maps. Both Sarkissov (1949) and
von Economo and Koskinas (1925) defined a separate cytoarchitectonic area on the subcentral gyrus similar in location to OP 4
(areas 43 and PFD respectively). This area was distinguished
from the rostrally adjacent agranular motor cortex (due to its
well developed layer IV) and the primary somatosensory cortex
(e.g., due to smaller cells in deeper layer III). The characterization of PFD provided by von Economo and Koskinas (1925) is
close to the description of OP 4: PFD is e.g. described as
containing large pyramidal cells in sublayers IIIc and Va. Such
cells were also found in OP 4. Like OP 4, PF D has a high cell
density, thick infragranular layers and a blurred cortex-white
matter border. However, there is one important difference
between these maps and our own results. Whereas area OP 4 is
followed rostrally by another granular area, PFD and BA 43
border the (agranular) motor cortex. Thus, another cytoarchitectonic entity might be included in the definition of both PF D
and BA 43


Vogt and Vogt (1919) defined several areas on the parietal
operculum based on their myeloarchitectonic studies. Two of
these areas (areas 73 and 74) are located completely in the
depth of the Sylvian fissure. Areas 72 and 88 are located
superficially and extend onto the free surface. This myeloarchitectonic parcellation of the parietal operculum is the only
‘classical’ brain map, which shows multiple cortical areas on the
parietal operculum and includes areas, which do not extend
onto the free surface. This myeloarchitectonic map is thus most
similar to our own cytoarchitectonic results, which also shows
the existence of several opercular areas, two of which (OP 2 and
OP 3) are not found on the free surface of the brain.

SII Maps in Non-human Primates
The human SII region is considered to be homologous to the
SII cortex of non-human primates (Burton et al., 1993;
Disbrow et al., 2000). Based on converging evidence from
microelectrode mapping, histological examination and tracing
experiments on cortico-cortical and thalamic connectivity

Figure 11. (A) Border between OP 1 and the inferior parietal cortex (IPC) (brain 7, section 3661). The position of the profiles and the significant (P \ 0.05) maximum of the
Mahalanobis distance function (A1) are indicated in the corresponding cell-body-stained sections (A2). In the IPC, the pyramidal cells in layer IIIc are less prominent, layer VI is
smaller and forms a more distinct border to white matter. (B) Border between OP 2 and the retroinsula (Ri) (brain 7, section 3541). The significant (P \ 0.05) maximum at position
32 (B1), matches the position of cytoarchitectonic changes (B2). Towards the retroinsula the cell density in layers IV and VI decreases, medium-sized pyramidal cells in lower layer
III appear and the white matter border becomes more blurred. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale bar 5 1 mm.

Figure 12. (A) Border between OP 3 and the granular insula (Ig) (brain 7, section 4171). The border was identified by the Mahalanobis distance (A1), revealing a significant
maximum at profile position 60. The location of this profile is marked in the corresponding histological image (A2). The insular cortex is thicker, contains bigger, more prominent
pyramidal cells and has larger infragranular layers and a more blurred white matter border. Roman numbers designate cortical layers; scale bar 5 1 mm.


(Krubitzer et al., 1986, 1993, 1995; Krubitzer and Kaas, 1990;
Burton et al., 1995; Disbrow et al., 2003), the existence of
multiple areas within the SII region is now considered a general
feature of the somatosensory cortex of anthropoid primates
(Kaas and Collins 2003) The most commonly used parcellation


scheme for the SII region is as follows (Figs 1 and 15): the
opercular area located immediately adjacent to the SI cortex is
termed the parietal ventral area (PV). Area PV is followed
caudally by area SII. It has to be pointed out, that this ‘area SII’ is
not equivalent to the ‘SII region’ but denotes an individual area

deeper in the Sylvian fissure medially adjacent to area SII and PV.
Based on its topography OP 4 may correspond to the
primate area PV: like PV, OP 4 is located superficially within
the Sylvian fissure close to the central sulcus and borders the

primary somatosensory cortex (SI). OP 1 is located caudally to
OP 4 next to the inferior parietal cortex, suggesting that it is
a human analogue to area SII. However, the human anatomy
seems to differ from the topographical relationships observed
for non-human primates in the respect that OP 1 (i.e. area SII)
borders the anterior parietal areas 1 and 2 in only a very few
cases, whereas in non-human primates there is a consistent
border between area SII and area 1 (Coq et al., 2004). Like
areas SII and PV, OP 4 and OP 1 share a common border
running in a medial to lateral direction. Topologically OP 3 is
a good candidate for a human analogue of VS (Fig. 15): OP 3 is
located deeper in the Sylvian fissure than OP 1 and OP 4
(which represent the possibly analogue to areas SII and PV)
and borders both of these areas. No distinct area has yet been
described in SII cortex of non-human primates, which corresponds topographically to OP 2. Most authors examining the
cortex posterior to the primate SII region have described the
neurons in this region as responding to various and often
complex stimuli, including input from other sensory modalities like the auditory and vestibular systems (Robinson and
Burton, 1980; Akbarian et al., 1988; Krubitzer et al., 1995;
Guldin and Grusser, 1998). In summary, the objectively defined areal boundaries within the human parietal operculum
show good agreement with the primate data on that region.
This correspondence is be further corroborated by a metaanalysis of human functional imaging studies (Eickhoff et al.,
2005), which shows that the functional activations within
these areas follow the predictions from primate work: the
hand representation within the parietal operculum is found at

the border between OP 1 and OP 4, as is the case for their
topographical analogues in the primate brain areas SII and PV.

Functional Inhomogeneity of the Human SII Region
Functional imaging studies on the human somatosensory system
provided ample evidence of a functional inhomogeneity of SII. A
positron emission tomography (PET) study by Ledberg et al.
(1995), for example, revealed two separate foci within the
parietal operculum. The superficial one was activated by
roughness and length discrimination, the deeper one by
a somatosensory reaction time task. Two activations within
the SII region were also demonstrated in a PET study by Burton
et al. (1997): an anterior, deep focus was activated as the result
of direct touch of the finger, which is mediated mainly by
cutaneous receptors. A more caudal, superficial activation was
associated with stimulation by a ring like plectrum intended to
activate mainly deep receptors. Despite its lower spatial
resolution, a magnetoencephalography recording during median nerve stimulation also revealed two consecutive responses
located within the SII region. The earlier response was found
more anteriorly and medially to the later one (Mima et al.,
1997). In an fMRI study, Disbrow et al. (2000) stimulated the
hand, foot, face, hip and shoulder by sponge brushing. The
authors demonstrated two complete, somatotopically organized
body maps on the human parietal operculum, probably analogous to the primate areas SII and PV, as well as two additional
cortical fields whose somatotopy could not be consistently
resolved.
A functional segregation of the human SII cortex was also
suggested with respect to pain perception. In a PET experiment, non-painful and painful stimulation resulted in two
distinct activation clusters within the SII region (Coghill et al.,
1994). A recent fMRI study on the cortical representation of
pain and touch confirmed these results by demonstrating two
spatially separate activations within SII (Ferretti et al., 2003):
one was located on the subcentral gyrus, the other more
posterior within the Sylvian fissure. Only the activation of the
posterior focus was modulated by the perceived pain intensity.
Further evidence that only the posterior parts of the SII region
are involved in pain perception was provided by lesion studies:
only patients with lesions involving the posterior parietal
operculum showed a raised pain threshold on the contralateral
body side, whereas patients with more anterior lesions had no
deficits in pain perception (Greenspan and Winfield, 1992;
Greenspan et al., 1999).
This functional heterogeneity of SII favors the assumption
that the four cytoarchitectonic areas on the parietal operculum
represent functionally distinct regions. They likely contribute
differentially to somatosensory processing tasks (e.g. pain
perception, tactile attention and somatosensory working memory) which have been ascribed to SII. If activities from all four
areas have been labeled as located within ‘SII’, this might
potentially have caused confusion about the function of the
SII region. To answer the question of the functional meaning of
the structural differentiation, it is now necessary to correlate
the defined cytoarchitectonic areas with functional imaging
data as shown in Eickhoff et al. (2005).
