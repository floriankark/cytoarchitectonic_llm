# Observer-Independent Cytoarchitectonic Mapping of the Human Superior Parietal Cortex

The human superior parietal cortex (SPC; Brodmann areas [BA]
5 and 7) comprises the superior parietal lobule and medial wall of
the intraparietal sulcus (mIPS) laterally and the posterior paracentral
lobule and precuneus medially. Receptor autoradiographic and
functional studies indicate more complex segregations in the SPC
than suggested by Brodmann (1909). Differences to other historical
maps may be due to anatomical variability between brains and
different definition criteria for areas. To provide a reliable anatomical reference of the SPC, we performed an observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic mapping of this region in 10 human postmortem
brains. Cytoarchitecture was analyzed in cell-body--stained brain
sections using gray-level index profiles. Multivariate statistical
analysis of profile shape allowed the exact localization of
cytoarchitectonic borders and quantification of interareal differences. We identified 3 areas in BA 5 (5L, 5M, and 5Ci), 4 in BA 7
(7PC, 7A, 7P, and 7M), and 1 in the anterior mIPS (hIP3). Locations
of their borders relative to macroanatomical landmarks varied
considerably between brains and hemispheres. Cytoarchitectonic
profiles of areas 5Ci and hIP3 differed most from those of the
remaining areas, and differences between subareas were stronger
in BA 5 than in BA 7. These areas are possible structural correlates
of functional segregations within the SPC.

Introduction


The human superior parietal cortex (SPC) can be macroanatomically subdivided (Fig. 1) into 2 lateral parts, the superior
parietal lobule (SPL) and the medial wall of the intraparietal
sulcus (mIPS), and 2 medial parts, the posterior part of the
paracentral lobule (PCL) and the precuneus (PrC). In Brodmann’s
cytoarchitectonic map, the SPC comprises 2 main areas (Fig. 2):
1) Brodmann area (BA) 5 in the anterior SPL near the vertex and
on the posterior part of the PCL and 2) BA 7 occupying the
larger posterior part of the SPL and the PrC (Brodmann 1909).
Later Brodmann introduced a subdivision of BA 7 into anterior
BA 7a and posterior BA 7b (Brodmann 1914).
Further structural heterogeneity within human SPC has
recently been described using quantitative receptor autoradiography (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005; Scheperjans,
Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). Distinct distribution patterns
of receptor-binding sites of different neurotransmitter systems
revealed 3 subareas within BA 5 (areas 5L, 5M, and 5Ci;
Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005). Moreover, the distribution
patterns of neurotransmitter receptors in the anterior SPC were
similar to those of somatosensory areas, whereas the patterns in
the posterior SPC resembled those of the extrastriate visual
cortex (Scheperjans Palomero-Gallagher et al 2005)


These structural findings are in line with results from
functional imaging experiments, which showed complex segregations in human SPC. Different activations were observed
during reaching movements depending on somatosensory
(anterior SPL) or visual (posterior SPL) guidance and on the
location of the target in the visual field (central vs. peripheral/
anterior medial wall of the intraparietal sulcus [amIPS] vs.
posterior SPL; Prado et al. 2005; Wenderoth et al. 2006).
Furthermore, distinct activations in the parietal lobe were
reported during grasping (anterior lateral wall of the intraparietal sulcus) and reaching (amIPS, SPL, and PrC; Grefkes et al.
2002, 2004; Culham et al. 2006). The PCL is implicated in
somatosensory and motor related processing and plays an
important role in micturition control (Richer et al. 1993; Lim
et al. 1994; Allison et al. 1996; Sakakibara et al. 1999).
Functional imaging studies usually correlate cortical activations with Brodmann’s map (1909, 1914) using its 3-dimensional
representation in the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux (1988) as
an anatomical reference. This work, however, is derived from
visual cytoarchitectonic inspection of a single human postmortem brain (Brodmann 1909). Several other cyto- and
myeloarchitectonic maps of the SPC show considerably different areal patterns with a total number of areas ranging from 3 to
34 (see Discussion for details; Table 1; Figs. 2 and 3; Vogt 1911;
von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al.
1955; Batsch 1956).
Such profound differences may be caused by different subjective mapping criteria and staining techniques used by
different investigators. Another important factor may be the
interindividual anatomical variability between brains that is not
accounted for in these studies (Zilles et al. 2002, 2003; Uylings
et al. 2005). For the human brain, it has been repeatedly
demonstrated that the size and location of cytoarchitectonic
areas varies considerably between individuals even for primary
sensory areas like area 3b and BA 17 (Geyer et al. 1999;
Amunts et al. 2000). The exact position of cytoarchitectonic
borders between areas cannot be derived from macroscopical
anatomical landmarks like sulci or gyri (Geyer et al. 1996, 1999;
Amunts et al. 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001; Morosan et al. 2001;
Zilles et al. 2002; Uylings et al. 2005; Caspers et al. 2006; Choi
et al. 2006; Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006; Malikovic et al.
2007; Rottschy et al. 2007).
All historical microanatomical maps of the human parietal
cortex have a common drawback, which is the lack of
information about the cortex within the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS; Brodmann 1909, 1914; Vogt 1911; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al. 1955; Batsch
1956). However, anatomical and functional studies in nonhuman primates and human brains have revealed several


-----

distinct cortical areas within this sulcus (Grefkes et al. 2002,
2004; Grefkes and Fink 2005; Choi et al. 2006; Culham et al.
2006; Iacoboni 2006; Orban et al. 2006; Fig. 4). In the human
brain, using observer-independent cytoarchitectonic mapping,
areas hIP1 and hIP2 have been recently identified in the fundus
and lateral wall of the anterior IPS, which may be homologues of
macaque areas AIP (anterior intraparietal area) and VIP (ventral
intraparietal area; Choi et al. 2006). In macaques, the mIPS
contains areas PEip (PE intraparietal, the rostral part of area
PEa of Pandya and Seltzer [1982]) and MIP (medial intraparietal
area; Matelli et al. 1998; Grefkes and Fink 2005). However, no
cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human mIPS is available yet.
Consequently, for the investigation of structure-function
relationships, there is a need for an anatomical reference of
the human SPC that is uninfluenced by observer bias and that
accounts for interindividual variability (Eickhoff et al. 2005). In
this study, we present such a reference using an observerindependent technique for the delineation and characterization
of cytoarchitectonic areas based on the statistical analysis of the
laminar cell-body distribution in sections of postmortem brains
(Schleicher et al. 1999, 2000, 2005; Amunts and Zilles 2001;
Zilles et al. 2002). This method has been extensively tested and
applied for several cortical regions including sensory and motor
areas (Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Amunts et al. 2000; Grefkes et al.
2001; Morosan et al. 2001; Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006;
Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy et al. 2007) as well as association

areas (Caspers et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2006). The interindividual
variability was assessed by analyzing the cytoarchitecture of
each area in 10 brains. This data can be used to create
a probabilistic map of the SPC in stereotaxic space (Amunts
and Zilles 2001; Mazziotta et al. 2001).

Histological Processing
Twelve human postmortem brains (Table 2; 6 male, 6 female, age range
37--86 years) were obtained from the Body Donor Program of the
Anatomical Institute of the University of Du¨ sseldorf from subjects with
no clinical history of neurological or psychiatric diseases (Fig. 5A). The
brains had been removed from the skull less than 24 h postmortem and
fixed for approximately 6 months informalin orinBodian’s fixative.During
fixation, the brains were suspended at the basilar artery to avoid
compression or distortion. The whole brains were embedded in paraffin
and serially sectioned (thickness = 20 lm) in a coronal (11 brains) or
sagittal (1 brain) plane (Fig. 5B). Each 15th section was stained for cell
bodies using a modified silver staining method (Merker 1983). Every 60th
coronal section (45th sagittal section) underwent analysis, resulting in
a distance between examined sections of 1.2 mm or 0.9 mm, respectively.
Due to artifacts in the histological sections of some brains, the sample
analyzed for area 7M differed from that of the other areas. Eight brains
were analyzed with respect to all areas, 2 were analyzed for area 7M
only, and 2 were analyzed for all areas except area 7M (Table 2). Thus,
each area was mapped in 10 brains.

Observer-Independent Delineation of Cytoarchitectonic
Borders
Borders between areas were identified using the method introduced by
Schleicher et al. (1999, 2000, 2005; Fig. 5 B-G). Rectangular regions of
interest (ROIs) were defined in the histological sections and scanned in
a meander-like sequence with a CCD camera (XC-75, Sony, Japan) and
a microscope (Universal, Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a computercontrolled motorized stage at an in-plane resolution of 1.05 lm per pixel
(Fig. 5B). Images were processed using the KS 400 image analyzing
software (Version 3.0, Zeiss). The gray-level index (GLI; Schleicher and
Zilles 1990), estimating the volume fraction of cell bodies (Wree et al.
1982), was measured by adaptive thresholding in continuously adjoining
square measuring fields (16 3 16 lm). In the resulting GLI image, each
pixel represents the local volume fraction of cell bodies in the
corresponding measuring field (Fig. 5C).
In each GLI image (i.e., ROI), the outer (between layers I and II) and
inner (between layer VI and the white matter) cortical contours were
interactively traced using in house software (MATLAB, The MathWorks,
Inc., Natick, MA). The contour lines defined the start (outer contour)
and end (inner contour) points of curvilinear traverses (spacing = 100
lm), which were calculated using a physical model based on electric
field lines (Jones et al. 2000; Fig. 5D). Curvilinear traverses offer the best
available solution because they follow the distortions of the cortical

minicolumns caused by cortical folding and cross the cortical layers
more perpendicularly than straight lines, especially in strongly gyrified
cortex (Schleicher et al. 2005). GLI values were extracted along the
course of the traverses from the surface to the white matter (= GLI
profile). To compensate for variations in cortical thickness, each profile
was resampled with linear interpolation to a standard length corresponding to a cortical thickness of 100% (0% = border between layers I
and II; 100% = border to the white matter; Fig. 6). The profile shape was
described using a 10-dimensional feature vector, composed of the mean
amplitude and the first 4 statistical moments of both the profile and the
absolute of its first differential quotient (Schleicher et al. 2000; Zilles
et al. 2002).
Differences between the feature vectors, that is, between the shapes
of the profiles, reflected differences in cytoarchitecture and were
quantified using the Mahalanobis distance (MD; Mahalanobis et al.
1949; Schleicher et al. 2000). Distances were calculated between
feature vectors from 2 abutting blocks of b (= block size) adjacent
profiles to increase the signal-to-noise ratio. Blocks of profiles were
analyzed in a sliding window of size 2b, which was moved along the
cortical ribbon with single-profile increments. The dependency of the
MD between profile blocks on the window position was described by
the MD function (Fig. 5E). Maxima of the distance function are expected
to occur at positions where the sliding window is centered over a border
between adjacent cortical areas and were tested for significance using
a Hotelling’s T[2] statistic with Bonferroni correction (Schleicher et al.
1999; Fig. 5E). A significant maximum was further processed if no higher
maximum was found within one block size on either side. This sliding
window procedure was repeated for block sizes 8 < b < 24, and the
significant maxima at different block sizes were plotted as a function of
the window position (Fig. 5F). The frequency of significant maxima at
each window position was determined and those borders further
processed that had a frequency of at least 4 and no neighboring border
with a higher frequency within an interval of 37 profiles on either side
(a window of about twice the average cortical thickness; Fig. 5G). This
threshold for accepting a cytoarchitectonic border was set relatively low
because the cytoarchitectonic differences within the SPC were expected to be very subtle. This increased the risk of detection of falsepositive borders caused by artifacts (e.g., blood vessels). However, all
detected borders were microscopically verified and only accepted if
they were reproducible in several adjacent sections (Figs. 7--9).

Statistical Analysis of Cytoarchitecture Using GLI Profiles
For each delineated cytoarchitectonic area, a sample of representative
GLI profiles was extracted from 3--5 cortical ROIs per hemisphere (on
average 34 profiles per ROI), which were free of histological artifacts,
minimally curved, and orthogonally cut. The ROIs were systematically
sampled within the whole extent of each area in order to represent all
parts equally A mean profile was calculated for each ROI


The shape of each GLI profile is not influenced only by the laminar
cytoarchitectonic pattern that is specific for the respective area.
Confounding factors can be specific for the individual brain (e.g., global
cell packing density) or specific for each ROI (e.g., distortions of the
laminar pattern, i.e., of the relative width of each cortical layer, caused by
cortical folding; von Economoand Koskinas 1925; Bok and von Kip 1936).
We separated the effect of global cell packing density from that of
area-specific laminar cytoarchitecture by normalizing all profiles by
dividing them by their mean GLI value (Eickhoff et al. 2007). To
eliminate the effects of cortical folding, we used piecewise linear width
normalization (PLWN) for the normalized mean GLI profiles (Eickhoff
et al. 2007; Fig. 6). First, the cortical depths of the interlaminar borders
were determined for each ROI using a semiautomatic method based on
the superimposition of its mean GLI profile and the respective
cytoarchitectonic section (Eickhoff et al. 2007). The basic principle
was the detection of the steepest local increases/decreases of the
profile curve (i.e., turning points), which occur at the transition
between layers with relatively high GLI (layers II, IV, and VI) and layers
with relatively low GLI (layers III and V; Figs. 10--13). A similar approach
has been applied earlier by Amunts et al. (1995). The cortical depths of
the interlaminar borders were then averaged across areas, hemispheres,
and brains resulting in one overall pattern of interlaminar borders. For
each ROI, the profile segments of the mean profile between the
interlaminar borders were linearly stretched or shrunk to match this
template (Eickhoff et al. 2007). The preservation of cytoarchitectonic
profile information by PLWN is illustrated in Figure 6 where a mean
profile across hemispheres and 10 brains is shown for area hIP3. In the
‘‘raw’’ mean profile, the variance in the relative width of each cortical
layer between the ROIs of the same area leads to a blurred representation
of the area’s specific laminar cytoarchitecture. In the PLWN-corrected
mean profile, the laminar cytoarchitectonic pattern is represented in
more detail, as can be seen by comparison with Figure 13. Consequently,
for each area, the resulting mean-normalized, PLWN-corrected GLI
profile represents its specific laminar cytoarchitectonic pattern.
Dissimilarity of cytoarchitecture was quantified by calculating the
Euclidean distance (ED) between the GLI profiles and tested for
significance using permutation tests (Eickhoff et al. 2007; MATLAB, The
MathWorks, Inc.). Because no significant interhemispheric differences in
the shape of these profiles were found (P [>] 0.05), profiles were averaged
across hemispheres for the analysis of interareal differences (significance
level P [<] 0.05; family wise error corrected). The dissimilarity of the
cytoarchitecture between the areas was visualized using multidimensional scaling (MDS; Fig. 14; SYSTAT 10.1, SPSS Inc., San Jose, CA). For visualization of the specific differencesin the laminarpattern between selected
areas, difference profiles were calculated for each brain by subtraction
of 2 mean profiles and subsequently averaged across brains (Fig. 15).
The mean GLI of the profiles provides valuable information about
cytoarchitectonic differences between areas It was analyzed separately

Analysis of Topographical Relations
Topographical relations were visually determined in the histological
sections separately for each hemisphere. The analysis was focused on
the location of the areas and of their borders with respect to anatomical
landmarks. These landmarks included the lateral and medial brain
surface, crowns of major gyri, and both walls and the fundi of major
sulci. To look for an effect of the hemisphere on the location of the
areas/borders, we tested for the independence between the hemisphere and the probability with which each area/border was found at
a particular landmark using two-by-two contingency tables and Fisher’s
exact test (2-tailed; significance level P < 0.05). For significant
interdependencies, we calculated odds ratios (OR) and their 95%
confidence intervals (CI) if no cell had a probability of zero.

Results


The human SPC and amIPS consist of granular isocortex. Eight
areas were reliably distinguished in this region by differences in
cytoarchitecture: 3 in the region of BA 5 (5L, 5M, and 5Ci), 4 in
the region of BA 7 (7PC, 7A, 7P, and 7M), and 1 in the amIPS
(hIP3).

Observer-Independent Delineation of Cytoarchitectonic
Borders
Figures 7--9 depict representative ROIs showing cytoarchitectonic borders in cell-body--stained sections and corresponding
plots showing significant maxima of the MD function indicating
the location of these borders. Figures 10--13 show the respective
areas at higher magnification as well as mean profiles of the areas
across hemispheres and brains. Because these profiles were
PLWN corrected for each area individually and not mean
normalized, they contain the complete cytoarchitectonic information specific for the respective area (laminar cytoarchitectonic pattern, mean GLI, and relative width of cortical layers).

from the profile shape (see above). No significant correlation between
age and the mean GLI was found for any area (P [>] 0.05; Bonferroni
corrected for multiple comparisons; mean Fisher’s z from both hemispheres �z = 0:20 ± 0:14 corresponding to mean Pearson’s correlation
coefficient �r = 0:20). Interhemispheric differences in mean GLI were
tested for significance using analysis of variance (ANOVA; blocking
factor: brain; Fig. 16). Because no significant differences were found (P [>]
0.05), interareal differences were tested using ANOVA (blocking factor:
brain) with values averaged from both hemispheres (significance level
P [<] 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).
No significant correlation between age and laminar width was found
for any area or layer (P [>] 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons; �z = 0:39 ± 0:30; �r = 0:37). For each area, the differences
of the width of the cortical layers between hemispheres were tested
for significance using multivariate analysis of variance (MANOVA)
with hemispheres as within factor and layers as main factor (blocking
factor: brain). Because no interhemispheric differences were found (P [>]
0.05), the test for interareal differences was performed using values
averaged from both hemispheres (Fig. 17). Global interareal differences
were first tested for homogeneity using MANOVA (blocking factor:
brain) with brain regions as main factor and layers as dependent
variables to protect the overall significance level. Because the null
hypothesis was excluded (P [<] 0.05; Bonferroni corrected for multiple
comparisons), differences between areas for each layer were subsequently tested with ANOVA (significance level P [<] 0.05; Bonferroni
corrected for multiple comparisons)


Borders between BAs 5 and 7 and Area hIP3
Common cytoarchitectonic features of BAs 5 and 7 were
a gradual transition from layer II to layer III, a continuous
increase (= gradient) of the volume fraction of pyramidal cells
from upper to lower layer III, and a sublamination of layer V
(Figs. 7 and 10--12). Both latter features were reflected as
increases (layer III) or decreases (layer V), respectively, in the
corresponding mean GLI profiles (Figs. 10--12: arrowheads). In
upper layer Va, the volume fraction of the pyramidal cells
was greater than in lower layer Vb (Fig. 7B: inset at bottom;
Figs. 10--12: arrowheads). Hence, layer Vb appeared as a bright,
sharply demarcated stripe, which separated layer Va from
layer VI (Fig. 7B: inset at bottom; Figs. 10--12: arrowheads).
The gradients within layers III and V, however, were stronger in
BA 7 than in BA 5 (Fig. 7A: arrowheads; Figs. 10--12; see below)
and differed also between their subareas (see below). A
characteristic feature of BA 5 was the occurrence of interspersed ‘‘giant’’ pyramidal cells in layers Va and Vb, which
exceeded the average size of the cells of this layer (Figs. 7A and
10: insets). The frequency of these cells differed between the
subareas (see below).
The main features distinguishing hIP3 from BAs 5 and 7 were
a sharper transition from layer II to layer III (Fig. 7B: arrowheads), a noncontinuous, abrupt increase of the volume fraction
of cell bodies in lower layer III, and a non-sublaminated layer V
(Fig. 7B: inset at bottom; Figs. 10--13: arrowheads; see below).
The abrupt increase of the volume fraction in lower layer III
caused upper layer III to appear brighter compared with lower

layer III (Fig. 7B: arrowheads). Below the largest cells in lower
layer III, which were arranged in a band-like fashion, a narrow
stripe with a lower volume fraction of cell bodies was visible
which separated these cells sharply from layer IV (Fig. 13:
asterisks).

Borders of BAs 5 and 7 and Area hIP3 to Surrounding Areas
The characteristic feature of BAs 5 and 7 distinguishing them
from the surrounding areas was the abovementioned prominent
sublamination of layer V into 2 sublayers (Fig. 7B: inset at
bottom; Fig. 8: asterisks; Figs. 10--12: arrowheads; Fig. 9).
Compared with postcentral BA 2, additional characteristics of
BA 7 were a reduced volume fraction of cell bodies in upper
layer III resulting in a stronger gradient in layer III and a sharper
transition from layer II to layer III (Fig. 8A: arrowhead). An
additional distinct feature in BA 5 were the giant pyramidal


cells in layer V (Fig. 10: insets), which were absent in BA 2
(Fig. 8A).
The border of area 5Ci to the ventrally adjacent cingulate
cortex was characterized by a decrease of the volume fraction
of cell bodies in layers III and V in the latter region. At the
border to the rostrally adjacent cingulate cortex layer IV
disappeared. No giant pyramidal cells were found in layer V of
the cingulate cortex. Compared with BA 7, the volume fraction
of cell bodies in upper layer III was higher in the posterior
cingulate cortex (pCi) leading to a reduced gradient in layer III
and a more blurred transition between layers II and III (Fig. 8B:
arrowhead). Lower layer III in pCi showed volume fractions that
were comparable to (7A) or larger (7P and 7M) than those
found in BA 7 (Figs. 8B, 11, and 12).
Several different areas with heterogenic cytoarchitecture
abutting BA 7 were observed in the parieto-occipital sulcus

and (C) the higher volume fraction of cell bodies in lower layer III of BA 7 and the resulting more pronounced gradient compared with the POC

(POS). These areas were not analyzed in detail in the context of
the present study. Therefore, we only mention those criteria
that were common to this ‘‘parieto-occipital cortex’’ (POC). The
gradient in layer III of the POC was smaller than in BA 7, as was
the volume fraction of cell bodies especially in lower layer III
and layer V (Fig. 8C: arrowhead). Consequently, layer IV was
better discernable in the POC.
Within the IPS, area hIP3 had borders with areas hIP1 and
hIP2 laterally and with the posteriorly adjacent cortex in the
medial wall of the IPS (pIPS). The borders to areas hIP1 and hIP2
were characterized by a more gradual and a less pronounced
gradient in layer III of areas hIP1 and hIP2 (cf. Choi et al. 2006).
The border between layers II and III was less clear in areas hIP1
and hIP2. Additionally, area hIP1 had a generally reduced
volume fraction of cell bodies compared with area hIP3,
whereas area hIP2 had a higher volume fraction and lacked
the small stripe of very low volume fraction right above layer IV
(Fig. 13: asterisks). Compared with area hIP3, the pIPS had
a generally increased volume fraction of cell bodies (Fig. 9). In
layer III of both areas, the gradient was strong and abrupt, but
the largest pyramidal cells in the pIPS were not arranged in
a band-like fashion like in hIP3 but were more vertically
distributed (Fig. 9: arrowhead).

Subareas 5L, 5M, and 5Ci
In all subareas of BA 5, giant pyramidal cells were interspersed in
layer V (Fig. 10: insets) with strong intersubject variability
concerning size and frequency. These cells were less frequent
and smaller in area 5L than in area 5M (Fig. 10: insets).
Compared with area 5M, area 5L had smaller cells in layers III
and V (Fig. 10). The sublamination of layer V was most
pronounced in area 5L, corresponding to the GLI gradient
within this layer in the mean profile (Fig. 10: arrowheads). In the
upper part of layer VI, cells were arranged in a band-like fashion
in areas 5M and 5Ci, whereas they were more distributed in area
5L. In layer III of area 5Ci, the volume fraction of cell bodies was
reduced and showed a less pronounced gradient compared


with area 5M (Fig. 10). At the border between areas 5M and 5Ci,
layer IV became better discernable and the volume fraction of
cell bodies in layer V increased toward area 5Ci. In area 5Ci, the
frequency of giant pyramidal cells was the lowest within BA 5
(Fig. 10: insets), and the boundary to the white matter was
sharper than in area 5M (Fig. 10).

Subareas 7PC, 7A, 7P, and 7M
Within BA 7, area 7PC showed a stronger gradient of the volume
fraction of cell bodies in the superficial half of layer III in
comparison with area 7A (Fig. 11). In lower layer III, the
gradient was stronger in area 7A because the largest pyramidal
cells in area 7PC were spaced further apart than in area 7A (Fig.
11). Of the 4 areas, 7A and 7P were most similar to each other.
The cell size in layer III of area 7A was larger and the cell
packing density lower than in area 7P (Figs. 11 and 12). Mostly
due to the larger pyramidal cells in layer Va, the gradient of the
volume fraction of cell bodies in layer V was stronger and the
sublamination more prominent in area 7A than in area 7P (Figs.
11 and 12). In area 7M, the gradient in layer III was least
pronounced and pyramidal cells in lower layer III were
relatively small and more widely separated than in area 7P
(Fig. 12).


Analysis of Cytoarchitecture Using GLI Profiles

Analysis of Laminar Cytoarchitectonic Patterns
For the analysis of laminar cytoarchitecture, normalized GLI
profiles were PLWN corrected across areas to conform to one
overall pattern of interlaminar borders (mean cortical depths:
II/III 19%, III/IV 54%, IV/V 64%, and V/VI 79%).
Because the areas did not differ significantly between the
hemispheres, mean profiles across both hemispheres were used
for the MDS. The MDS arranged the points representing the
mean GLI profiles across brains in a 2-dimensional space
according to their degree of dissimilarity as measured by the

the respective rotated microphotograph shown below, insets showing the giant pyramidal cells in layer V at 2-fold higher magnification, and mean GLI profiles averaged across

lines demarcate the average cortical depths of the interlaminar borders for the respective area. Arrowheads indicate the representation of the sublamination of layer V in the GLI
profile (n 5 10).


ED (Fig. 14). High dissimilarity of 2 areas means that their points
are far away from each other, and low dissimilarity means that
they are close to each other. Each of the areas 5Ci, 5M, and hIP3
was separated from all other areas by relatively large distances,
that is, their profile shapes had a high degree of dissimilarity to
the shapes of the profiles of the remaining areas. The subareas of
BA 7 were positioned relatively close to each other. The profiles
of areas 7A and 7P were most similar, whereas areas 7PC and 7M
had a higher degree of dissimilarity. Area 5L was positioned
centrally between all other areas, but closer to the subareas of
BA 7 than to those of BA 5. In the pairwise permutation tests
between the areas the profile of area 5Ci was significantly


different from those of all other areas. The profile of area 5M was
significantly different from those of all areas, except area 5L. The
profile of area hIP3 was significantly different from those of all
areas, except areas 5L and 7PC.
The specific differences between the profiles of the main
areas 5 and 7 were visualized by subtracting a mean profile of
subareas 5L and 5M from a mean profile of all subareas of BA 7.
Area 5Ci was excluded because its profile differed significantly
from those of areas 5L and 5M. The resulting difference profile is
shown in Figure 15A. BA 7 had higher relative GLI values in layer
IV, upper layer V, and layer VI, but lower values in layer II, upper
layer III and lower layer V Consequently the GLI increase

within layer III and the GLI decrease within layer V were stronger
in BA 7 than in areas 5L/M (Fig. 15A), corresponding to the
abovementioned stronger gradients in BA 7 (Figs. 7A and 10--12).
The specific differences between the profiles of area hIP3 and
BA 7 were visualized by subtracting a mean profile of all
subareas of BA 7 from the mean profile of area hIP3. The
difference profile is shown in Figure 15B. Area hIP3 had higher
relative GLI values in layer II and a steeper GLI decrease toward
layer III (Fig 15B) corresponding to the sharper transition from


layer II to layer III in the cytoarchitectonic picture (Fig. 7B:
arrowheads). In upper and middle layer III, the values were
similar in both areas. However, in lower layer III, the GLI values
abruptly increased in hIP3 to higher relative values than in BA 7
(Fig. 15B). This corresponded to the sharply demarcated band
of pyramidal cells in hIP3, in contrast to the continuous gradient
in layer III of BA 7 (Figs. 11--13). In lower layer IV, the values in
hIP3 were below those of BA 7. Compared with BA 7, the GLI in
hIP3 was lower in upper layer V but nearly equal in lower layer

V (Fig. 15B), which can be attributed to the sublamination of
layer V in BA 7 which was not present in hIP3 (Fig. 7B: inset at
bottom; Figs. 11--13: arrowheads). In upper layer VI, values were
higher in area hIP3 and the GLI decrease toward the white
matter steeper than in BA 7.
The specific differences between the profiles of subareas 5M
and 5L are shown by the difference profile in Figure 15C. Area
5M had higher GLI values in layer III caused by the larger size
and thus larger volume fraction of cells compared with area 5L


(Fig. 10). Another difference in comparison with area 5L was the
lower GLI in upper layer V compared with higher values in
lower layer V of area 5M, corresponding to the less pronounced
sublamination (Fig. 10: arrowheads). Finally, the GLI value began
to decrease more superficially in layer VI of area 5M causing
a negative slope in the difference profile and corresponding to
the narrower band of cells in upper layer VI of area 5M (Fig. 10).
The specific differences between the profiles of subareas 5Ci
and 5M were visible when the mean profile of area 5M was

Figure 14. Scatter plot visualizing the results of the MDS for the mean GLI profiles of
the areas across hemispheres and brains. Profiles were mean normalized and PLWN
corrected across all areas and thus reflect laminar cytoarchitecture. MDS can be conceptualized as a rotation of the points representing the GLI profiles in 100-dimensional
space that maximizes their apparent dispersion in a 2-dimensional subspace. This
subspace is spanned by the 2 eigenvectors of the data matrix associated with the
largest eigenvalues and, hence, brings the principal components of the data into view.
The 2 principal components thus define the axes of the plot and the coordinate values
for individual areas represent their respective component loads (n 5 10).

subtracted from that of area 5Ci (Fig. 15D). In layer III, the
difference profile had a negative slope and showed lower values
in lower layer III of area 5Ci, corresponding to the reduced
volume fraction and gradient in the cytoarchitectonic picture
(Fig. 10). At the border between layers III and IV, there was
a sharp increase in the difference profile to higher relative GLI
values in layers IV and V of area 5Ci, which reflected the sharper
appearance of layer IV and the higher volume fraction of cell
bodies (Fig. 10). In layer VI, the slope of the difference profile
was negative representing the sharper transition to the white
matter in area 5Ci (Fig 10)


The laminar cytoarchitectonic differences between neighboring subareas of BA 7 (Figs. 11 and 12) were reflected in their
difference profiles (Fig. 15 E--G) although they were more
subtle than those between the profiles of the subareas of BA 5
(Fig. 15 C,D). This was in correspondence with the results of the
MDS (Fig. 14). Compared with the profile of area 7A, the profile
of area 7PC had a stronger increase of the GLI in the superficial
half of layer III (Fig. 15E), corresponding to the stronger
gradient of the volume fraction of cell bodies in area 7PC
(Fig. 11). In lower layer III, the slope of the difference profile
was negative (Fig. 15E), reflecting the wider spacing of the
pyramidal cells in area 7PC (Fig. 11). In layer III of areas 7A and 7P,
the opposite differences of cell size and packing density (Figs. 11
and 12) resulted in nearly equal volume fractions of cell bodies,
that is, GLI values (Fig. 15F). However, area 7A had higher relative
GLI values in upper layer V and a stronger decrease toward lower
layer V (Fig. 15F), corresponding to the more prominent
sublamination in area 7A (Figs. 11 and 12). The difference profile
of areas 7P and 7M had a positive slope in layer III (Fig. 15G),
reflecting the stronger gradient in area 7P (Fig. 12).

Analysis of Differences in Mean GLI
None of the defined areas showed significant interhemispheric
differences of the mean GLI (P > 0.05; Fig. 16). The ANOVA for
interareal differences in mean GLI across both hemispheres
revealed a significantly lower mean GLI in area hIP3 when
contrasted with areas 5L 7A 7P and 7M

Analysis of Differences in the Relative Width of Cortical
Layers
None of the areas and layers showed significant differences of
the width between both hemispheres (P > 0.05; Fig. 17). The
MANOVA for interareal differences using values averaged across
hemispheres showed significant heterogeneity of laminar width
in our sample (P < 0.05). The subsequent ANOVA revealed
a significantly wider layer IV in area 5Ci in comparison with area
5M. Area hIP3 had a significantly wider layer IV than areas 5M
and 7A and a significantly narrower layer V than areas 5M and
7M. Layer VI was significantly wider in area 7PC compared with
areas 5Ci, 5L, 7M, and hIP3.

Topography of the Delineated Areas with Respect to Each
Other and to Anatomical Landmarks
Values in parentheses indicate the percentage of the hemispheres in which the respective area/border was found at the
respective location (number of hemispheres n = 20, if not
indicated differently; Fig. 18).


Figure 18. Schematic overview of the approximate locations of the cytoarchitectonic
areas delineated in this study superimposed onto a 3-dimensional reconstruction of
a human brain. The topography of areas on the lateral aspect is shown on the left
hemisphere. A posterolateral segment of the left hemisphere is removed to allow the
inspection of the depth and medial wall of the IPS. The topography of areas on the
medial aspect is shown on the right hemisphere. The right hemisphere is coronally
sectioned at the level of the central sulcus to allow the inspection of the walls of the
CiS. White solid lines follow the superficial and dashed lines follow the deep course of
the major sulci. CaS, calcarine sulcus; CS, central sulcus; SF, sylvian fissure.

fundus: 90%; posterior wall: 85%). It was located medial and
posterior to BA 2 (cf. Grefkes et al. 2001) and extended in about
half of the hemispheres to the postcentral gyrus (60%) and in
90% to medial structures (cingulate sulcus [CiS]: 80%; PCL: 55%;
PrC: 55%). In 95% of the hemispheres, it did not extend up to
the IPS. In all left hemispheres, but only in half of the right
hemispheres (P < 0.05), it extended posteriorly up to the
anterior superficial part of the SPL (it was not possible to
calculate an odds ratio for this difference because there was
a 100%/0% ratio for left hemispheres). 2) Area 5M occupied
parts (or the whole) of the superior/anterior wall of the
posterior CiS (100%) and its ascending branch, extending to
the posterior wall in about half of the hemispheres (45%). It
reached to the PCL in 90% of the hemispheres and was located
medial to area 5L and posterior/ventral to BA 4. In about half of
the hemispheres, it extended into the medial branch of the
central sulcus (60%) or to the lateral surface (55%). 3) Area 5Ci
was located ventrally adjacent to area 5M in the superior wall of
the CiS (100%), reaching to the inferior wall in 40% and to the
PCL in half of the hemispheres. It extended further rostrally
than area 5M and was ventrally and rostrally adjoined by the
cingulate cortex (100%).


Brodmann Area 5
1) Area 5L was found in the postcentral sulcus (PoCS) near to
the interhemispheric fissure (PoCS: 100%; anterior wall: 75%;


Brodmann Area 7
1) Area 7PC was located on the lateral aspect of the anterior SPL
(95%), posterior to BA 2 (cf. Grefkes et al. 2001), and lateral to
area 5L. It occupied the posterior wall of the PoCS (95%)
extending into the amIPS (90%). In 90% of the hemispheres it
did not extend to the interhemispheric fissure. 2) Area 7A
abutted areas 5L and 7PC posteriorly, occupying the largest part
of the SPL (100%) and extending into the medial wall of the IPS
(100%) and onto the PrC (95%). On the PrC, the dorsoventral
location of the ventral border between area 7A and the
cingulate cortex relative to the subparietal sulcus (SuPS) was
variable (dorsal of SuPS: 95%; dorsal wall: 26%; fundus: 21%;
ventral wall: 5%; ventral of SuPS: 5%; n = 19). 3) Area 7P was
posteriorly adjacent to area 7A on the lateral and medial surface.


-----

The location of the border between these 2 areas showed a high
interindividual variability in the rostrocaudal dimension and was
not demarcated reliably by any macroscopical landmark (e.g.,
SPL surface: 100%; superior parietal sulcus: anterior wall: 15%;
fundus: 40%; and posterior wall: 50%). In only 20% of the left
hemispheres, the border was located in the posterior wall of the
superior parietal sulcus, whereas this was the case in 80% of the
right hemispheres (P < 0.05; OR 16.0, 95% CI: 1.8--143.2).
Laterally, area 7P extended to the IPS (70%) not as frequently as
area 7A. Posteriorly, area 7P reached into the anterior wall of the
POS in about half of the hemispheres (POS; 45%). Medially, it
had borders with area 7M (94%; n = 16) and the cingulate cortex
(80%). 4) Area 7M was located exclusively on the medial
surface, posterior/ventral to area 7P. The border between these
2 areas varied in dorsoventral location with respect to the SuPS
(dorsal of SuPS: 100%; dorsal wall: 33%; fundus: 53%; ventral wall:
20%; ventral of SuPS: 20%; n = 15). In 75% of the hemispheres,
the posterior parts of area 7M extended into the anterior wall of
the POS.

Area hIP3
Area hIP3 in the amIPS had borders with areas 7PC (90%) and 7A
(85%). In most hemispheres, the anterior borders of area hIP3
were with area 7PC (amIPS: 94%; SPL surface: 50%; posterior
wall of PoCS: 22%; n = 18), but occasionally, it extended into the
fundus of the PoCS, adjoining BA 2 (36%; n = 14) or area 5L
(25%). The locations of the borders with area 7A varied as well
(IPS: medial wall: 100%; fundus: 18%; SPL surface: 35%; n = 17).
Laterally, area hIP3 abutted areas hIP1 (IPS: medial wall: 43%;
fundus: 86%, lateral wall: 43%; n = 7) or hIP2 (IPS: medial wall:
69%; fundus: 85%; lateral wall: 23%; n = 13; cf. Choi et al. 2006).
Only in 10% of the hemispheres, area hIP3 extended posteriorly
up to the level of area 7P.


Discussion

In the present study, 8 areas within the human SPC were
delineated using observer-independent analysis of cytoarchitecture in 10 postmortem brains. This approach accounts for
interindividual variability and makes differentiation even between cytoarchitectonic areas with minor differences reliable
and reproducible. It represents a major advantage compared
with previously published maps, which were based on the
subjective visual analysis of brain sections from a very small
sample or even only one single brain (Brodmann 1909, 1914;
Vogt 1911; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940;
Sarkisov et al. 1955; Batsch 1956).
The algorithm detected borders between the areas consistently in all postmortem brains, although in the SPC, the
cytoarchitecture showed a considerable interindividual variability, and interareal differences were more subtle than in some
previously mapped cortical regions, primary areas in particular
(Geyer et al. 1999; Amunts et al. 2000). Interindividual differences in parietal white matter anatomy have been associated
with different levels of performance in visuospatial tasks (Tuch
et al. 2005; Wolbers et al. 2006). It can hence be speculated that
also interindividual differences in cortical cytoarchitecture
might contribute to differences in behavioral performance (cf.
Amunts et al. 2004).

Comparison with Previous Anatomical Descriptions
Structural segregations (Figs. 2 and 3) have been previously
described in human SPC in terms of cytoarchitecture (Brodmann


1914; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov
et al. 1955), myeloarchitecture (Vogt 1911; Batsch 1956),
receptorarchitecture (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005;
Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005), and connectivity
(Rushworth et al. 2006).
The correspondence between our parcellation and those of
previous authors is summarized in Table 1. Except for the
pattern of areas in the mIPS (see below), the topographical
extent of the areas in the SPC delineated in the present study
was comparable to that reported in earlier publications (Figs. 2,
3, and 18; Brodmann 1909, 1914; Vogt 1911; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al. 1955; Batsch 1956;
Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001; Choi et al. 2006;
Vogt et al. 2006). Previous maps differ mainly in the number of
areas described within the SPC (Zilles et al. 2003; Table 1).
Besides the abovementioned methodological factors, this may
be attributed to the fact that the histological differences
between the areas of the SPC and the surrounding cortex are
relatively strong compared with those between the subareas
within the SPC. Our map shows more subareas (Table 1; Figs. 2
and 18) than the maps of Brodmann (1909, 1914), von Economo
and Koskinas (1925), and Sarkisov (1955). It resembles more
the parcellation scheme suggested by Vogt (1911), Gerhardt
(1940), and Batsch (1956), if only the main areas in these maps
are considered (Table 1; Figs. 3 and 18). The extensive
subparcellations of the main areas that were, for example,
published by Gerhardt (1940), who delineated 34 subareas
based on the analysis of one hemisphere, likely correspond to
fluctuations of the cytoarchitectonic pattern within these areas.
Such fluctuations might reflect topically organized functional
spatial representations (Luppino et al. 1993; Fink et al. 1997;
Sereno and Huang 2006) and were also observed in individual
brains in the present study. However, no constant pattern
emerged across the whole sample of brains that would be
sufficienttoderiveadditionalsubparcellations.Thisdemonstrates
that a sufficient sample size is needed in anatomical studies to
separate genuine reproducible cytoarchitectonic differences
between areas from individual cytoarchitectonic fluctuations.
The cytoarchitectonic descriptions of previous publications
were mostly well reproducible in our study (Brodmann 1909;
von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Grefkes et al.
2001; Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005; Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005; Choi et al. 2006). The giant pyramidal cells
in layer V (Fig. 10: insets) were previously mentioned as
the main feature characterizing BA 5 (Brodmann 1909; von
Economo and Koskinas 1925; Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005).
Von Economo and Koskinas (1925) classified area PA2 (i.e., BA 5;
Table 1) as a subarea of area 3a of the primary somatosensory
cortex. This, however, was neither confirmed in the present
study nor by a recent observer-independent analysis of transmitter receptor distribution patterns, which suggested that BA 5
is clearly separated from area 3a and belongs to the parietal
association cortex (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005). Gerhardt
(1940) noted that in area 75, which corresponds to BA 5 (Table
1), the giant pyramidal cells were not homogeneously distributed and not found in subarea 75scm in the CiS (Fig. 3). This is in
line with our finding that these cells were rarely found in area
5Ci as compared with areas 5M and 5L (Fig. 10: insets). Our
cytoarchitectonic subparcellation of BA 5 is further supported
by a recent study showing distinct transmitter receptor
distribution patterns in areas 5L, 5M, and 5Ci (Scheperjans,
Grefkes et al 2005)


-----

Von Economo and Koskinas (1925) noted a decrease of cell
size within the region corresponding to BA 7 from rostral area
PEm to caudal area PEp (Table 1; Fig. 2). This is confirmed by our
finding of decreasing cell size from area 7A to area 7P (Figs. 11
and 12). However, we did not observe any equivalent of their
most posterior subarea PEc with larger pyramidal cells compared with area PEp. Rostrocaudal differences within BA 7 have
also been described for transmitter receptor distribution
patterns and linked to different functional properties of
different subregions within this area (see below; Scheperjans,
Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). Comparison of the present
parcellation with this recent receptorarchitectonic study suggests that the measuring sites 7PC, 7A, and 7P from that study
had been placed in cytoarchitectonic areas 7PC, 7A, and 7P
from the present study, respectively (Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005). In the previous study, it was concluded
that anatomical differences within BA 7 are more pronounced in
the rostrocaudal than in the mediolateral dimension (Scheperjans,
Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). However, in the present study,
area 7M was delineated ventrally on the PrC. Retrospectively, it
can be assumed that this area was not included in the
receptorarchitectonic study because data was obtained only
from dorsal sites in the PrC near to the vertex. Consequently, we
have to revise our previous statement (Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005) in the sense that mediolateral anatomical
differences exist in BA 7 at least in terms of cytoarchitecture.
In previous maps (Table 1; Fig. 2), the whole mIPS was often
regarded as part of BA 2 (area PD; von Economo and Koskinas
1925) or BA 7 (Talairach and Tournoux 1988; Brodmann 1909).
We cannot support this assumption because, in the present
study, a new area (hIP3) was delineated in the amIPS, which was
clearly distinct from BAs 5 or 7 in terms of cytoarchitecture
(Figs. 7 and 10--17). We agree with Grefkes et al. (2001), who
reported that BA 2 does not extend into the IPS and with Choi
et al. (2006), who delineated distinct cytoarchitectonic areas
(hIP1 and hIP2) in the lateral wall of the IPS.
Besides the abovementioned anatomical mapping techniques,
immunohistochemistry is a powerful method to structurally
parcellate the cerebral cortex. Most frequently applied in this
context is the staining of a subset of corticocortically projecting
pyramidal neurons, predominantly in lower layer III and upper
layer V, using SMI-32 antibodies against nonphosphorylated
neurofilaments (Campbell and Morrison 1989; Hof et al. 1995).
With respect to a parcellation of the parietal cortex, to our
knowledge, this method has so far been applied only for the
brains of nonhuman primates (Hof and Morrison 1995; Lewis
et al. 1999; Lewis and van Essen 2000; Luppino et al. 2005;
Gregoriou et al. 2006). It seems to be more difficult to detect
area-specific patterns in the human brain because of a greater
proportion of immunoreactive neurons (Campbell and Morrison
1989). Evidence has been provided that cyto- and myeloarchitectonic borders between macaque superior parietal areas
PE and PEc and the surrounding cortex (e.g., PEc/V6A,
PE/cingulate cortex; Fig. 4) colocalize with changes in the size,
shape, and distribution of SMI-32 immunoreactive pyramidal
neurons (Hof and Morrison 1995; Lewis and van Essen 2000;
Luppino et al. 2005). The border between macaque areas 2 and
PE is more clearly visible in SMI-32 stainings than in cytoarchitectonic preparations (Lewis et al. 1999). Several borders
between subareas of the SPC (e.g., PE/PEip, PE/MIP) can be
seen in SMI-32 stained sections as well (Hof and Morrison 1995;
Lewis and van Essen 2000) In the present study 8 areas were


reliably delineated based on cytoarchitectonic differences in
the human SPC. Important distinctive features were the size and
arrangement of pyramidal cells in layers III and V (Figs. 7--13
and 15). Therefore, immunohistochemical-selective staining of
a subset of these cells with corticocortical connections using,
for example, SMI-32 antibodies, may be useful in future studies
to validate or extend the here presented parcellation. Furthermore, such data may be linked to connectivity patterns of the
delineated areas as revealed by magnetic resonance imaging
(Rushworth et al. 2006).
The analysis of the topographical relationships of the
cytoarchitectonic areas revealed that, although the relative
positions of the 8 areas were comparable between hemispheres
and subjects, the locations of their borders with respect to
macroanatomical landmarks showed strong interindividual
variations. Therefore, the macroscopical structure of gyri and
sulci cannot be used to predict the precise locations, sizes, or
shapes of cytoarchitectonic areas in the SPC. This phenomenon
has been noted previously with respect to other cortical regions
(Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Amunts et al. 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001;
Morosan et al. 2001; Caspers et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2006;
Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006; Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy
et al. 2007) but is accounted for neither in historical brain
atlases (Brodmann 1909, 1914; Vogt 1911; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al. 1955; Batsch
1956) nor in modern 3-dimensional adaptations of these maps
(Talairach and Tournoux 1988). Probabilistic maps in stereotaxic space include information about intersubject variability
and are the most suitable tools for the assignment of cortical
activations to cytoarchitectonic areas in functional imaging
studies (Amunts and Zilles 2001; Mazziotta et al. 2001; Zilles
et al. 2002; Eickhoff et al. 2005; Uylings et al. 2005; Eickhoff,
Heim, et al. 2006).

Analysis of GLI Profiles and Structural Relations
between Areas


SPL, PrC, and PCL
Within BA 5, area 5Ci had the highest degree of dissimilarity to
the remaining areas in terms of profile shape and laminar width
(Figs. 10, 14, 15, 17). The GLI profiles of area 5L were more
similar in shape to those of BA 7 than to those of areas 5M or 5Ci
(Fig. 14). Areas 5L and 5Ci were nevertheless classified as parts
of BA 5 because giant pyramidal cells, the characteristic feature
of BA 5, were interspersed in layer V of both areas (Fig. 10:
insets). Due to their only sporadic occurrence, these cells were
not adequately represented in the GLI profiles. It has been
recently described that transmitter receptor distribution patterns of areas 5L, 5M, and 5Ci are similar to those of area 7PC
(Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). However, the
patterns of area 5L are even more similar to those of postcentral
somatosensory BA 2 and those of area 5Ci are more similar to
those of the cingulate cortex (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005;
Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). Thus, the different subareas of BA 5 combine neurochemical and cytoarchitectonic features, which relate each of them differently to the
surrounding postcentral, cingulate, and posterior parietal areas.
The borders between the subareas of BA 7 were detected as
significant maxima of the MD function in the sections of the
individual brains, although the cytoarchitectonic differences
within BA 7 were more subtle than within BA 5 (Figs. 14 and 15).
The analysis of GLI difference profiles revealed differences


-----

between areas 7PC, 7A, 7P, and 7M (Fig. 15 E--G),which were,
however, smaller than those between the main areas 5, 7, and
hIP3 (Fig. 15 A,B), supporting our classification of these areas as
subareas of BA 7. Possibly due to the strong interindividual
cytoarchitectonic variability, the mean profiles of these 4 areas
across brains did not differ significantly in the permutation tests.
Cytoarchitectonic differences within BA 7 were strongest
between areas 7PC and 7M and more subtle between areas 7A
and 7P (Figs. 11, 12, 14, and 17). Additionally, the GLI profiles of
area 7PC were similar in shape to those of area 5L (Fig. 14).
However, layer VI was significantly wider in area 7PC (Fig. 17).
In terms of receptor architecture, area 5L is closest related to
the somatosensory cortex (BA 2; Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005). Receptor distributions in area 7P are
most similar to those of the extrastriate visual cortex. Areas 7PC
and 7A show different degrees of anatomical similarity to
adjacent areas, depending on the applied mapping technique
(Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005). Subtle cytoarchitectonic differences were found between areas 7A and 7P but
no mediolateral differences within each area. This is in line with
receptorarchitectonic observations where differences between
areas 7A and 7P were stronger than between medial and lateral
sites within each of these areas (Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005).
In summary, the cytoarchitectonic analysis of the SPC in this
study corroborated the results of previous receptorarchitectonic investigations concerning the subparcellation of BAs 5 and
7. However, it becomes clear that the measured degrees of
architectonic similarity between cortical (sub)areas can differ
depending on the mapping technique. This is not surprising
because each method visualizes different structural correlates
of physiological processes, which in concert are the basis for
the specific functional properties of each cortical area.

Anterior Medial Wall of the IPS
Area hIP3 in the amIPS was clearly distinct from the other
delineated areas in terms of laminar pattern and mean GLI (Figs.
7 and 10--17). In this area, layer IV had a larger and layers V and
VI a smaller relative width compared with several other areas
(Fig. 17). This is probably reflecting the influence of cortical
folding on laminar width because profiles of area hIP3 were
nearly exclusively sampled from the depth of the IPS, whereas
those of the other areas (5M, 7PC, 7A, and 7M) were more often
sampled from the free cortical surface (generally, deep cortical
layers tend to be relatively narrower and superficial layers
relatively wider in sulci than at the crowns of gyri; von Economo
and Koskinas 1925; Bok and von Kip 1936; Eickhoff et al. 2007).
Concerning the significantly wider layer IV and narrower layer
VI in area 5Ci compared with areas 5M and 7PC, respectively,
a similar effect may play a role (Figs. 10, 11, and 17). This is less
likely with respect to the differences between area 7PC and
areas 5L and 7M (Figs. 10--12 and 17).


Comparison of Structural and Functional Data from
Human and Macaque SPC
The pattern of areas in the human SPC that was revealed in the
present study resembles the commonly assumed areal configuration of the macaque SPC (Figs. 4 and 18; Pandya and Seltzer
1982). The macaque SPC shows a rostrocaudal parcellation into
areas PE and PEc on the lateral and mediodorsal surface


resembling the rostrocaudal arrangement of areas 5L, 5M, and
7PC (rostral) and areas 7A and 7P (caudal). In line with these
structural findings, regionally different functional properties
have been described within the SPC of both species, for
example, gradients of the relative functional influences of the
somatosensory (anterior SPL) and visual (posterior SPL) modalities (Mountcastle et al. 1975; Squatrito et al. 2001; Stoeckel
et al. 2004; Breveglieri et al. 2006; Wenderoth et al. 2006). This
rostrocaudal functional scheme is structurally reflected in terms
of neurotransmitter receptor distributions which show similar
patterns in the anterior SPC (particularly area 5L) and somatosensory cortex, whereas the patterns in the posterior SPC
(particularly area 7P) resemble those of extrastriate visual areas
(Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005).
The human posterior PCL (i.e., anterior medial SPC; BA 5) can
be activated by somatosensory stimulation if subjects attend to
the stimuli and electrostimulation of this region can elicit motor
responses (Richer et al. 1993; Lim et al. 1994; Allison et al. 1996;
Forss et al. 1996). Additionally, the PCL plays an important role
for the cerebral control of micturition (Sakakibara et al. 1999).
In the CiS of the macaque, a higher order sensorimotor area
(PEci) has been described at a location comparable to that of
human area 5Ci (Figs. 4 and 18; Murray and Coulter 1981;
Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Shima et al. 1991; Lacquaniti et al.
1995; Morecraft et al. 2004).
In humans and macaques, neural activity in the SPL, PrC, and
the mIPS, which are sometimes referred to as parts of the
parietal reach region (PRR), is functionally associated with
somatosensory and visuomotor integration, particularly related
to reaching movements, as well as visuospatial attentional and
memory processes (Gre` zes and Decety 2001; Battaglia-Mayer
and Caminiti 2002; Buneo et al. 2002; Connolly et al. 2003;
Rizzolatti and Matelli 2003; Cavanna and Trimble 2006; Culham
et al. 2006; Curtis 2006; Hahn et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006; Pellijeff
et al. 2006; Ricciardi et al. 2006). Activation patterns in the SPL/
IPS during visually guided reaching differ, however, depending
on whether the target is presented in the center (mIPS) or the
periphery (additionally posterior SPL) of the visual field (Prado
et al. 2005). Also attentional processes involve separate parts of
the SPC and IPS differently (Molenberghs et al. 2007). Besides its
abovementioned properties, the PrC is one of the so-called
cortical midline structures which are related to self-referential
processing and are implicated in the ‘‘default mode’’ of brain
function (Raichle et al. 2001; Cavanna and Trimble 2006;
Northoff et al. 2006). In the present study, 3 areas (7A, 7P,
and 7M) were delineated on the PrC, which might correspond
to previously described functional segregations in this region
(Cavanna and Trimble 2006). In macaques, the ventral part of
the PrC is occupied by area PGm (Fig. 4; Pandya and Seltzer
1982). It could be speculated that this area corresponds to
human area 7M.
In the human and macaque IPS, several distinct regions have
been anatomically and functionally characterized (Fig. 4; Lewis
and van Essen 2000; Grefkes et al. 2004; Grefkes and Fink 2005;
Choi et al. 2006; Culham et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006; Orban et al.
2006; Rushworth et al. 2006). Because the human IPS has
a much more complex structure than the macaque IPS, direct
structural comparisons of this region between species are
difficult (Choi et al. 2006). In the macaque mIPS (Fig. 4; Matelli
et al. 1998; Grefkes and Fink 2005), the most commonly
described areas are PEip (anterior) and MIP (posterior). Several
functionally distinct areas have also been identified in the


-----

human (e.g., dorsal IPS anterior [DIPSA], dorsal IPS medial

[DIPSM], the human MIP equivalent [hMIP]); however, no
generally accepted parcellation exists (Grefkes et al. 2004;
Grefkes and Fink 2005; Culham et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006;
Orban et al. 2006). The present study is the first to provide
evidence for a distinct cytoarchitectonic area (hIP3) in the
amIPS.
It seems reasonable to assume that the here described
subareas of BAs 5 and 7, as well as area hIP3, are the structural
correlates of functional segregations within the human SPC.

Interhemispheric Differences
Statistically confirmed interhemispheric differences in cytoarchitecture have been described for several cortical areas
based on sample sizes comparable to that of the present study
(e.g., primary motor cortex and Broca’s area; Amunts et al. 1996,
2003; Uylings et al. 2006). Reports about structural asymmetries
of superior parietal gray matter are inconsistent (Good et al.
2001; Watkins et al. 2001; Luders et al. 2006). In the functional
domain, rightward lateralization has been described within
parietal cortex for attentional processes (Culham et al. 2006).
However, many tasks involving reaching showed contra- or
bilateral activations (Culham et al. 2006). In the present study,
we found no evidence for interhemispheric differences of areaspecific cytoarchitecture in the SPC. Any confounding effect of
differential cortical thickness between hemispheres was excluded because the length of every GLI profile was normalized
for subsequent analyses. However, on the macroscopical level,
the topography of 3 cytoarchitectonic areas and their borders
(5L, 7A, and 7P) in relation to anatomical landmarks showed
significant interhemispheric differences, which may be functionally relevant. In addition to the analysis of white matter
pathways (Barrick et al. 2007), volumetric analyses of cytoarchitectonically defined cortical areas may be useful in the future
for the detection of anatomical correlates of hemispheric
functional specialization in the SPC.
We plan to present in the near future probabilistic maps in
stereotaxic space (Amunts and Zilles 2001; Mazziotta et al.
2001) and volumetric analyses of the areas delineated in the
present study. This may reveal additional anatomical substrates
of functional differences between, for example, hemispheres or
genders. Furthermore, the maps will enable investigators to
directly correlate activations obtained from functional imaging
experiments with observer-independently acquired cytoarchitectonic information to explore structure-function relationships
within the SPC (Eickhoff et al. 2005; Eickhoff, Heim, et al. 2006).
