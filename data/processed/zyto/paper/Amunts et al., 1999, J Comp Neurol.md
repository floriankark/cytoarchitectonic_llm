ABSTRACT
The sizes of Brodmann’s areas 44 and 45 (Broca’s speech region) and their extent in
relation to macroscopic landmarks and surrounding areas differ considerably among the
available cytoarchitectonic maps. Such variability may be due to intersubject differences in
anatomy, observer-dependent discrepancies in cytoarchitectonic mapping, or both. Because a
reliable definition of cytoarchitectonic borders is important for interpreting functional
imaging data, we mapped areas 44 and 45 by means of an observer-independent technique. In
10 human brains, the laminar distributions of cell densities were measured vertical to the
cortical surface in serial coronal sections stained for perikarya. Thousands of density profiles
were obtained. Cytoarchitectonic borders were defined as statistically significant changes in
laminar patterns. The analysis of the three-dimensional reconstructed brains and the two
areas showed that cytoarchitectonic borders did not consistently coincide with sulcal contours.
Therefore, macroscopic features are not reliable landmarks of cytoarchitectonic borders.
Intersubject variability in the cytoarchitecture of areas 44 and 45 was significantly greater
than cytoarchitectonic differences between these areas in individual brains. Although the
volumes of area 44 differed across subjects by up to a factor of 10, area 44 but not area 45 was
left-over-right asymmetrical in all brains. All five male but only three of five female brains had
significantly higher cell densities on the left than on the right side. Such hemispheric and
gender differences were not detected in area 45. These morphologic asymmetries of area 44
provide a putative correlate of the functional lateralization of speech production. J. Comp.

The cytoarchitectonic areas 44 and 45 are located at the
inferior frontal gyrus and occupy the partes opercularis
and triangularis (Brodmann, 1909). It is widely accepted
that both areas constitute the anatomical correlates of
Broca’s region (Aboitiz and Garcia, 1997). The analysis of
Broca’s region (Broca, 1861) is of long-standing interest
because fluent speech is most likely to be affected by
lesions of the left inferior frontal gyrus, where Broca’s
region is located (Brown, 1972; McGlone, 1977; Mohr et al.,
1978; Levine and Mohr, 1979; Damasio, 1992; Buckner et
al., 1996; Caplan et al., 1996). This region also seems to
participate in stuttering (Fox et al., 1996; Braun et al.,
1997). It has been demonstrated that the homologous
region in the right, nondominant hemisphere may be
involved in prosodic aspects of speech (Botez and Wer

theim, 1959) and in the detection of syntactic errors
(Bradvik et al., 1991; Nichelli et al., 1995). More detailed
functional aspects of Broca’s region were examined by
investigators using different verbal tasks and positron
emission tomography (Ingvar and Schwartz, 1974; Roland
et al., 1985; Petersen et al., 1988; Mazziotta and Metter,

1988; Demonet et al., 1992; Zatorre et al., 1992; Mazoyer et
al., 1993; Petrides et al., 1993; Frackowiak, 1994;
Nathaniel-James et al., 1997). Functional magnetic resonance imaging (McCarthy et al., 1993; Desmond et al.,
1995; Binder et al., 1996; Hertz-Pannier et al., 1997;
Indefrey et al., 1998), magnetoencephalography (Martin et
al., 1993), and electrical stimulation (Penfield and Rasmussen, 1949; Ojeman, 1991) have also been employed. Activation was usually elicited in the left inferior frontal gyrus,
but in some cases it was also found in the homologous
region of the right hemisphere (Roland et al., 1985;
Mazoyer et al., 1993; Just et al., 1996). Gender-specific
lateralization has recently been discovered: activation in
males occurred only in the left inferior frontal gyrus but on
both sides in females (Shaywitz et al., 1995). Unfortunately, these researchers did not substantiate this finding
statistically. Gender differences in other anatomical measures of asymmetry (e.g., surface or volume) have been
described for several regions including the Sylvian fissure,
the planum parietale and corpus callosum (Berrebi et al.,
1988; Kertesz et al., 1990; Habib et al., 1991; Witelson and
Kigar, 1992; Ja¨ncke et al., 1994; Steinmetz et al., 1995; Ide
et al., 1996), and Broca’s region (Uylings et al., 1999).
Previous cytoarchitectonic studies did not report on differences between the areas of the anterior speech regions of
either side of normal brains (Brodmann, 1909; Economo
and Koskinas, 1925). Therefore, it is still a matter of
discussion whether or not cytoarchitectonic features are
associated with functional lateralization of speech (Galaburda, 1980; Scheibel et al., 1985; Simonds and Scheibel,
1989; Jacobs et al., 1993a; Hayes and Lewis, 1995; Hayes
and Lewis, 1996).
The early cytoarchitectonic analyses of both areas were,
to a large extent, restricted to qualitative descriptions of
cell morphology and laminar patterns (Kononova, 1949).
In some studies, qualitative aspects (Stengel, 1930; Riegele,
1931; Strasburger, 1938) were supplemented by quantitative measurements (Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Kononova, 1935; Rabinowicz, 1967). The classic descriptions
differ considerably with respect to the extent, location, and
sizes of areas 44 and 45 (Fig. 1). Architectonic features
were reported to be highly variable among subjects (Kononova, 1935). Variability also concerns, e.g., the size of
area 44 on the free surface of the pars opercularis (compare the maps of Brodmann and Economo–Koskinas with
those of the Russian school), the location of area 45 with
respect to the horizontal branch of the Sylvian fissure
(compare the maps of Economo–Koskinas with those of
Brodmann and the Russian school), and the sulcal patterns of the pars triangularis. In addition, the surrounding
areas also differ between maps. Whereas Brodmann found
that areas 46 and 9 are located in the dorsal neighborhood
of areas 44 and 45, the Russian school reported that areas
8 and 9 but not area 46 constitute the neighborhood of
areas of 44 and 45. It has to be considered that the maps
themselves present only the superficially exposed part of
the cortical surface. A much larger part of the surface,
however, is buried in the sulci (Falzi et al., 1982; Zilles et
al., 1988).
The precise functional differences between both areas
are still not known. In some verbal tasks, clusters of
functional activation were scattered over the entire extent
of Broca’s region (Demonet et al., 1992; Hinke et al., 1993;
Mazoyer et al., 1993; Hirano et al., 1996), but, in other
tasks, activation occurred only in parts, i.e., in locations

In addition to structural variability, the previous methods for defining cytoarchitectonic borders may have contributed to interobserver differences. It is well known that the
definition of cytoarchitectonic borders depends to a large
extent on the experience and abilities of the investigator to
recognize patterns. This methodological aspect must be
considered when critically evaluating previous studies
(Bonin and Bailey, 1961). Because local changes in the
laminar distribution of cell packing densities have long
been a major criterion for defining areal borders in conventional cytoarchitectonic studies (Brodmann, 1909), we
have applied a new quantitative and observer-independent approach to compare these densities. The laminar
distribution of cell densities was measured with an automated microscopic scanning procedure using an image
analysis system (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990). The resulting gray level index (GLI) is a reliable measure of cell
packing density in the cortex (Wree et al., 1982). The
approach can be used to quantitatively describe cytoarchitecture by measuring the GLI distribution along a vertical
trajectory from the cortical surface to the white matter
(Schleicher and Zilles, 1990). Statistically significant
changes in the laminar distribution of the GLI can be
detected at the transition between two cytoarchitectonic
areas but not within an homogeneous area (Schleicher et
al., 1995, 1998). A procedure based on the detection of such
changes in GLI has been shown to be sensitive for interhemispheric, ontogenetic, and areal differences (Zilles et
al., 1986b; Schlaug et al., 1995b; Amunts et al., 1996, 1997;
Geyer et al., 1996, 1997). Thus, this procedure avoids
observer-dependent influences in defining areal borders
and makes possible the statistical testing for significant
changes in cytoarchitectonic organization.
The aims of the present study were to (1) determine the
positions and extents of areas 44 and 45 in the left and
right hemispheres in serial histologic sections through 10
human brains by applying an observer-independent procedure for the definition of cytoarchitectonic borders, (2)
examine whether there are any areal-, side-, and genderdependent differences in the cytoarchitecture of the two
areas, (3) test whether it is possible to predict the precise
location of cytoarchitectonic borders on the basis of sulcal
features, and (4) analyze intersubject variability in the
extent and cytoarchitecture of both areas.

## MATERIALS AND METHODS Subjects


of the University of Du¨sseldorf or from collaboration
between the Anatomical Institute and departments of
pathology in accordance with legal requirements. The
autopsies were performed within 8–24 hours after death.
Case 3 came from a subject with transitory motor disturbances (not affecting speech); all other subjects had no
indications of neurologic or psychiatric diseases in clinical
records. Handedness and language dominance of the subjects were not known. Considering an incidence of about
95% of left-sided language dominance (Branche et al.,
1964), it is likely that most of our cases were dominant for
the left side.

## Histology


The brains were fixed in either in 4% buffered formalin
(pH 7.4) or a mixture of formalin, glacial acetic acid, and
ethanol (Bodian mixture). The whole paraffin-embedded
brains were serially sectioned in the coronal plane; 6,000–
7,500 sections (20 µm thick) per brain were obtained. Each
15th section was mounted on a glass slide and silver
stained for cell bodies (Merker, 1983). Each 60th section of
the total number was used for analysis.

## Quantitative cytoarchitecture


Ten human brains (five male, five female; age range �
37–85 years) were studied (Table 1). Subjects were obtained by body donor programs of the Anatomical Institute


Regions of interest (ROIs) containing Broca’s region
were selected for quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis.
The GLI (Zilles et al., 1986; Schleicher and Zilles, 1990) is
a measure of the volume fraction of somata per volume of
unit brain tissue. It is highly correlated with cell density
(Wree et al., 1982). The GLI was determined by using an
image analyzer (KS400, Zeiss) connected to a microscope
with a motor stage for automated scanning and focusing.
Digitized high-resolution GLI images of the ROIs were
obtained and printed (Fig. 2A). The GLI of each pixel of
these images represents the volume fraction occupied by
cell bodies in a square measuring field of 32 � 32 µm.
Laminar changes in cortical cell density were registered
as GLI profiles along trajectories running parallel to the
orientation of cell columns, i.e., vertical to the cortical
surface, from the border between layers I and II to the
border between the cortex and white matter. The profiles
covered the cortex in the ROIs at equidistant intervals of
approximately 128 µm (Fig. 2A). Positions of profiles were
numbered consecutively from 1 to n, where n was the
number of profiles per ROI.
Each GLI profile (see Fig. 3, Table 2) was characterized
by a set of 10 features (feature vector). Features were
based on central moments (Dixon et al., 1988), as follows:
the mean GLI value (meany.o), the center of gravity in the
x-direction (meanx.o), the standard deviation (sd.o), the
skewness (skew.o), the kurtosis (kurt.o), and the analogous

parameters for the first derivative of each profile (meany.d,

certain degree abstract parameters that were derived from
the mathematical analysis of frequency distributions.
They allowed a quantitative analysis of the shapes of
profiles and of the differences between neighboring profiles
(Schleicher et al., 1995, 1998). Some features, however, can
be interpreted directly in terms of cytoarchitecture: the
mean GLI increases with increasing density of cell bodies.
The feature meanx.o will be smaller than 50% if the
supragranular layers have a higher GLI than the infragranular layers; and vice versa, if the infragranular layers
show more densely packed cell bodies than the supragranu

case 6. A: Digitized image with a cortical region containing parts of
areas 44 and 45. The gray value of each pixel in this image indicates
the volume fraction of cell bodies, which is a good estimate of cell
packing density: a high gray level index (GLI) is represented by a dark
pixel, a low GLI by a correspondingly brighter pixel. The cortex was
covered with vertical lines running from the border between layers I
and II to the cortex/white matter border. Along each line, a GLI profile
was measured. In this case, the positions of the profiles were numbered from 1 to 41, with equidistant intervals of approximately 128
µm. B: Location of the image shown in A in the corresponding section

(asterisk). This peak marked the border between areas 44 and 45. The
smaller peak at position 20 was not accepted as a border different from
that at position 24 because the distance between both peaks at
positions 20 and 24 is below the resolution given by the block size of 10
profiles. D: Corresponding micrograph with the border between areas

## Observer-independent definition of borders

The observer-independent definition of borders between
cortical areas is based on the assumption that feature
vectors of cell density profiles from two different cytoarchitectonic areas differ significantly, whereas profiles in one
and the same area are not significantly different. The
differences between profiles were evaluated by using multivariate statistics. They were expressed as the Mahalanobis distances (D[2]) between two adjacent blocks of profiles,
each of which consisted of 10 neighboring profiles. The
width of a block was approximately 1.28 mm. After the
calculation of D[2] for two adjacent blocks of profiles, both
blocks were shifted simultaneously by �128 µm (i.e., one
profile) to the next possible location. In this manner, D[2]
was calculated continuously for all sequential positions of
all possible blocks of profiles in the region studied (Fig.
2C). For example, D[2] at position 10 was calculated between
the first block containing the profiles 1–10 and the second


-----

block containing the profiles 11–20 (Fig. 2C). D[2] at position
11 corresponded to the distance between the block with
profiles 2–11 and the block with profiles 12–21.
D[2] increases with increasing differences in the shapes of
the profiles of two neighboring blocks. A subsequent Hotelling T[2] test was applied for testing the significance of each
D[2] value. Borders between areas were defined only at
those positions that showed significant distances at a level
of �� 5%. In the case of multiple significant maxima
within a distance of 1.28 mm, i.e., within the width of one
block, only the highest maximum was accepted and the
smaller maxima were rejected (Schleicher et al., 1998;
compare the peaks at positions 20 and 24 in Fig. 2C,D).
Thus, the spatial resolution in the present study is 1.28
mm.

## Interareal, interhemispheric, and gender comparisons of cytoarchitectonic parameters and volumes


garded. Differences in relative layer thickness were analyzed with ANOVA. The statistical design of the three-way
ANOVA was as follows: the three factors were area (44,
45), side of hemisphere (left, right), and layer (II, III, IV, V,
VI); the blocking factor was subject.
The volumes of areas 44 and 45 were measured according to Cavalieri’s principle (Uylings et al., 1986). In
dependence on the extent of each area, 7–11 sections were
analyzed per brain and hemisphere to calculate the volumes. Left–right comparisons of volumes were performed
by a paired (left vs. right hemisphere) t-test with Bonferroni correction for multiple tests (P � 0.025). Asymmetry
coefficients for volumes (ACvol) were calculated similar to
equation (1). Statistical analysis was performed by using
the software package SYSTAT.

## Analysis of intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture


After defining the borders of areas 44 and 45, interareal,
interhemispheric, and gender differences in cell density
were investigated. Three ROIs were sampled per area and
hemisphere. For selecting the ROIs, all sections in which
areas 44 and 45 occurred were subdivided into three
samples, equal in numbers of sections. From each sample,
one section was selected randomly for quantitative analysis. Eight equidistant GLI profiles were measured per
section and area. The profiles were normalized to a cortical
depth of 100% to compare regions of different cortical
thicknesses. One mean profile for each area and hemisphere was calculated by averaging 24 GLI profiles (3
sections � 8 profiles). Thus, a total of 40 mean profiles (10
brains � 2 hemispheres � 2 areas) was obtained for
interareal and interhemispheric comparisons. Differences
in cytoarchitecture between the hemispheres of each brain
and between areas were analyzed by calculating the
Mahalanobis distances between the profiles and applying
the Hotelling’s T[2] test (�� 0.05).
The mean GLI, collapsed over all layers (overall cell
density), was calculated for a cortical area in each brain
and hemisphere. Side and gender differences were tested
by analysis of variance (ANOVA). The statistical design of
this two-way ANOVA was as follows: the two factors were
side of hemisphere (left, right) and gender (male, female);
the blocking factor was subject. The level of significance
was Bonferroni-corrected from 0.05 to 0.025 for multiple
comparisons (male and female).
Left–right differences in overall cell density were analyzed further by using the asymmetry coefficient (AC, %)
as described previously (Uylings et al., 1984; Galaburda et
al., 1987). Differences were calculated for areas 44 and 45
according to the formula

AC � 100% � (GLIL � GLIR)/[(GLIL � GLIR )/2] (1)


Intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture was analyzed by comparing intraareal (intersubject) differences in
profiles obtained from one and the same area of different
brains, with interareal (intrasubject) differences between
profiles from area 44 and profiles from area 45 of each
single brain. Mean D[2] for intraareal and interareal differences were thus calculated. The number of possible intraareal differences for all brains was 45. This number was
calculated as (9 � 10)/2 (each of the 10 brains was
compared with the 9 remaining brains; this value was then
divided by 2 because the results are identical when brain A
is compared with B or, vice versa, brain B is compared with
A). The number of possible interareal differences was 10
(one comparison between areas 44 and 45 per brain).
There was no significant left–right asymmetry in interareal differences; thus, profiles of the left and the right
hemispheres were collapsed for examining interareal differences. The significance of D[2] between intraareal (intersubject) and interareal differences was tested by a KruskalWallis one-way rank analysis (�� 0.05). This procedure
answers the question of whether intersubject variability in
cytoarchitecture of areas 44 and 45 is greater or lower than
interareal differences in each brain.

## Cytoarchitectonic identity of areas defined by the present approach


where GLIL and GLIR are the mean cell densities for the
left and right hemispheres, respectively.
Relative layer thicknesses were calculated in areas 44
and 45 to estimate the proportion of each layer in relation
to cortical depth as a whole. The thicknesses of the cortical
layers II–VI were measured after identification under the
microscope. Layer IV of area 44 appeared to be invaded by
pyramidal cells from neighboring layers III and V. Its
thickness was defined by the presence of granular cells.
Single pyramidal cells from layers III and V were disre

The cytoarchitectonic identity of the areas determined
by the present quantitative approach was established by
comparing the present findings with the descriptions and
micrographs published by Economo and Koskinas (1925).
Their FCBm corresponds to Brodmann’s and our area 44,
and their FD� corresponds to Brodmann’s and our area 45
(Fig. 1). The description by Economo and Koskinas does
not differ essentially from that of Kononova (1949) who
used Brodmann’s nomenclature except for the slight modification of introducing subarea 45a at the rostral border of
area 45 (Fig. 1). FCBm (area 44) is a dysgranular area
between the agranular frontal (premotor cortex) and the
granular prefrontal cortex. The index m indicates that this
area has conspicuously large pyramidal cells in deep layer
III (magnopyramidal). The height of deep layer III nerve
cell bodies is 60–70 µm, and the width is 25 µm. The
borders of layer IV to layers III and V undulate. The cortex
of FCBm is not sharply delineable from the underlying
white matter. FCBm contains clearly visible cell columns
and a distinct but thin layer II. Layer V can be subdivided


-----

**AREAS 44 AND 45** **325**


into an upper sublayer with more densely packed cells and
a lower sublayer with fewer cells. FD� (area 45) has a
thinner cortex than FCBm but has distinct horizontal
layering and prominent cell columns in addition to large
pyramidal cells in deep layer III (Economo and Koskinas,
1925). The identification of the neighboring areas (6, 8, 9,
10, 46, 47, insula) was also based on criteria provided by
Economo and Koskinas. For identifying areas 9 and 46, the
results of a recent study by Rajkowska and GoldmanRakic were also considered (1995a,b).
In conclusion, the cytoarchitecture of our areas 44 and
45 closely fits that of previous descriptions of these areas
by Economo and Koskinas (1925) and Kononova (1949).
Brodmann’s (1909) description is too cursory for sufficiently detailed comparison. More recent cytoarchitectonic
criteria of areas 9 and 46 were also recognizable in our
sections (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995a,b).

## Superimposition of areas 44 and 45 on the surface of the brain


The borders of areas 44 and 45 were displayed on
three-dimensional (3-D) reconstructions of the individual
brains. This required several steps. High-resolution magnetic resonance (MR) sequences of the postmortem brains
were obtained after fixation but prior to embedding, sectioning, and staining, as previously described (Roland and
Zilles, 1994; Zilles et al., 1995; Amunts et al., 1996; Geyer
et al., 1996). MR imaging was performed with a Siemens
1.5 T magnet (Erlangen, Germany) with a T1-weighted
FLASH sequence (flip angle � 40°, repetition time � 40
msec, echo time � 5 msec for each image). Each volume
consisted of 128 sagittal sections that covered the entire
brain. Spatial resolution was 1 � 1 � 1.17 mm (Steinmetz
et al., 1990). Each voxel had a resolution of eight bits
corresponding to 256 gray values. The brain volumes were
spatially transformed into the standard format of the
human brain atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994) and oriented
in the plane determined by the anterior–posterior commissures, i.e., the AC–PC plane (Talairach and Tournoux,
1988).
Images of histologic silver-stained sections were digitized with a CCD camera. To reconstruct the histologic
volume, each brain was represented by three data sets: (1)
the histologic data set with high contrast but with distortions caused by histologic techniques, (2) a photo-data set
with low contrast (resulting from the unstained surface of
the paraffin block) showing the histologic section before
sectioning and a reference system to establish the 3-D
integrity of the histologic volume, and (3) and the MR-data
set obtained prior to embedding with improved contrast
but at a slightly different orientation than the photo-data
set (Schormann and Zilles, 1998). The comparison of these
three data sets allowed us to correct for deformations and
shrinkage inevitably caused by histologic techniques, e.g.,
embedding, sectioning, and mounting on glass slides. Both
linear affine and nonlinear fluid transformations were
applied (Schormann et al., 1993, 1995; Schormann and
Zilles, 1997, 1998).
The extents of areas 44 and 45 on both sides in the
histologic sections were interactively traced into the corresponding MR image by using an image analysis system
(KS400, Zeiss). The cytoarchitectonic areas were 3-D reconstructed. The surface rendering of the 3-D reconstructed
areas was performed by using the AVS software package
(Uniras, Germany).


## RESULTS Identification of areas 44 and 45 and definition of borders

Area 44 was identified on the basis of conspicuously
large pyramidal cells in deep layer III and in layer V and
by a barely recognizable dysgranular layer IV, which was
invaded to different degrees by layer III and V pyramidal
cells (Fig. 4A). Area 45 differed essentially from area 44 by
the presence of a clearly visible layer IV. Due to the more
pronounced layer IV, the horizontal layering of area 45 also
appeared more conspicuous than did that of area 44. Layer
IV of area 45, however, was less distinct than that in the
rostrally adjoining prefrontal cortex, e.g., in areas 10 or 46
(Fig. 4B). These qualitative findings allowed us to identify
regions that had been delineated with the observerindependent quantitative procedure as cortical units comparable to Brodmann areas 44 and 45.
The observer-independent approach demonstrated significant differences between the shapes of cell density
profiles in areas 44 and 45 after multivariate statistics and
a noneuclidean distance function was applied (see section
Observer-independent definition of borders). The distance
function showed maximal values when the profiles were
located at the opposite sides of an areal border. As an
example, Figure 3 shows neighboring profiles from the
border between areas 44 and 45 in subject 6 (Fig. 2). The
laminar distribution pattern of cell bodies, i.e., the feature
vectors, differed significantly between areas 44 and 45
(P � 0.05; see also Table 2).
This border between areas 44 and 45 was detectable in
all 10 brains (Figs. 2, 5, 6). Only in three sections did a
significant ‘‘border’’ detected by the automated procedure
need to be rejected because of histologic artifacts (tissue
defects introduced by the sectioning and mounting procedures). It is readily understandable that such artifacts
alter the laminar pattern and will lead to the detection of
artificial ‘‘borders.’’ However, such artifacts were always
easily recognizable and clearly localizable in the distance
function curve. Smaller ruptures of the tissue, as shown in
Figure 7, did not cause artificial borders.
In addition to the borders between areas 44 and 45, we
found other significant borders within each area. These
borders subdivided areas 44 and 45 into two or more parts,
each of which had an extent of approximately 3–8 mm
along the cortical surface (e.g., Fig. 7). These borders were
not ‘‘artificial,’’ i.e., caused by artifacts. They could be
identified on adjacent histologic sections. In some cases,
such borders were found at the transition between the
crown and the wall of a gyrus (e.g., border within area 44
at position 52 in Fig. 7). Other borders did not coincide
with changes in gyral geometry (e.g., border at position 68
in Fig. 7). Because a systematic mapping of all subdivisions in areas 44 and 45 was not within the scope of the
present study, further observations will be necessary for
an analysis of the significance of these subdivisions and
their possible association with functional heterogeneity in
Broca’s region.
The outer borders of Broca’s region (borders to Brodmann’s areas 6, 8, 9, 10, 46, 47, and to the insular cortex) were
also defined by using the observer-independent procedure
(Figs. 6–11). Area 47 is located ventral to areas 44 and 45.
However, area 47 does not seem to be homogeneous
because it consists of several subareas. These subareas are
arranged in a lateroorbital sequence (Kononova, 1935). By

that the cytoarchitectonic borders did not coincide with
reliably identifiable macroscopic features, e.g., with a
fundus of a sulcus. Thus, macroscopic anatomy and areal
borders differ independently.

## Thickness of cortical layers and cell densities

Differences in relative thickness of cortical layers were
not found between areas 44 and 45 with the exception of
layer IV (ANOVA; significant interaction between the
treatment factors area and layer; F � 3.2, df � 3, P � 0.05).
Layer IV was relatively thicker in area 45 than in area 44
(Table 3). Gender- and side-dependent differences in relative layer thicknesses could not be detected (P � 0.05).
However, overall cell densities showed both genderdependent and interhemispheric differences (two-way
ANOVA). Cells bodies were more densely packed in the left
than in the right area 44 (13.6%, S.E. � 0.57 vs. 12.7%,
S.E. � 0.57; F � 9.5, df � 1, P � 0.025). The interaction
between area and gender was not significant due to
correction for multiple tests (F � 5.6, df � 1, P � 0.025).
However, all five male brains showed a higher overall cell
density in the left than in the right area 44. Thus, theAC of
cell density was greater than zero in all male brains (Fig.
13). In contrast, three of five female brains showed a
left-over-right asymmetry (AC � 0), but the remaining two
showed a right-over-left asymmetry (AC � 0). The overall
cell densities in area 45 did not show significant asymmetry or gender differences (Fig. 13).
Although significant differences were found between the
cell density profiles of areas 44 and 45 in each subject
(intrasubject, interareal differences), they could not be
detected when mean profiles, collapsed over the entire
sample (intersubject, interareal) were compared (Mahalanobis distance D[2] � 10.03, Hotelling T[2] � 50.15, F � 2.5,
df1 � 10, df2 � 9, P � 0.09). A comparison of mean profiles
averaged over the entire sample for areas 44 and of 45 is
illustrated in Figure 14. This finding points to the large
intersubject variability in the cytoarchitecture of each
cortical area.

the right side (left: 3,839.9 mm[3], S.D. � 2,277.8 vs. right:
2,527.6 mm[3], S.D. � 1,597.9; t � 5.4, df � 9; P � 0.001). All
10 brains showed this leftward asymmetry. Side differences in area 45, however, were not significant (left:
3,242.1 mm[3], S.D. � 1,149.4 vs. right: 3,173.8 mm[3], S.D. �
1,637.7; t � 0.1, df � 9; P � 0.025). Gender differences in
volume did not reach significance for either area 44 or 45.
The absence of significant side differences in the volumes
of area 45 was caused by differences in the direction of
asymmetry across the 10 brains: five had larger volumes
on the left and five had larger volumes on the right (Fig.
16).

## Location of areas 44 and 45


We further analyzed intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture by calculating the Mahalanobis distance (D[2]) between profiles of homologous areas in different brains (see
section Interareal, interhemispheric, and gender coparisons of cytoarchitectonic parameters and volumes). The
test showed large differences in the cytoarchitecture of
area 44 across subjects (Fig. 15, left box). The same was
found for area 45 (Fig. 15, middle box). Both D[2] values
appeared to be significantly greater than those for the
intrasubject differences between profiles of areas 44 and
45 in each single brain (Fig. 15, right box). Thus, intraareal (intersubject) differences in cytoarchitecture were
greater than interareal differences in each individual
brain (P � 0.05). These results were independent of
side-of-hemisphere and gender.

## Volumes of areas 44 and 45


We also found high intersubject variability in the volumes of both areas (Fig. 16). Volumes ranged from 920
mm[3] (area 44, right hemisphere, case 5) to 9,403 mm[3]
(area 44, left hemisphere, case 3). Nevertheless (see S.D.,
below), there was a stable relationship between the volumes of area 44 on the left and right sides. Area 44 had, on
average, a significantly greater volume on the left than on


We examined the position of Broca’s region with respect
to anatomic landmarks such as gyri and sulci. In all 10
cases, area 45 was present at the free cortical surface of the
triangular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. It was located
rostral to the ascending branch of the lateral fissure. Area
44 was always found on the free cortical surface of the
opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus. Lateral views
of two 3-D reconstructed brains with the cytoarchitectonically defined areas are presented in Figure 17.
Areas 8, 9, 46, and 10 adjoin Broca’s region rostrodorsally (Figs. 6 and 9 show examples of the border between
areas 45 and 9; Fig. 10 shows an example of the border
between areas 45 and 10; Fig. 7 shows an example of the
border between areas 44 and 8). The dorsal border lies
close to the inferior frontal sulcus in classic maps, but our
analysis showed that its position in the sulcus differed
across individuals. It may lie in the ventral or dorsal bank
of the sulcus, but it never reached the free surface of the
middle frontal gyrus. Intersubject differences in the position of the border in relation to the fundus of the inferior
frontal sulcus reached 1.5–2 cm in sections cut perpendicular to the gyral surface. In addition, this sulcus was
sometimes interrupted and thus consisted of several segments. In theses cases, it was not possible to correlate the
position of the complete extent of the dorsal border with a
consistent macroscopic feature such as the fundus of the
sulcus.
The caudal border of area 44 adjoins area 6 (see also Fig.
8). The location of this border differed between the rostral
and caudal walls of the precentral sulcus and thus differed
with respect to the fundus by approximately 1–2 cm in this
sample.
In most of the cases, the ventrorostral border of area 45
was located dorsal to the fundus of the horizontal branch of
the lateral fissure and its continuation. In four hemispheres, however, this border was found on the ventral
wall of the horizontal branch. In these cases, area 45
extended onto the orbital surface of the inferior frontal
gyrus.
The border between areas 44 and 45 was located in the
surrounding of the ascending branch of the lateral fissure
in some hemispheres (Fig. 17B, right hemisphere). In
others, it was close to the diagonal sulcus (Fig. 17A, right
hemisphere) or even interposed between both sulci (Fig.
17A,B, left hemispheres). The diagonal sulcus was present
in only nine of the 20 hemispheres. Even when the border
between areas 44 and 45 was located in the diagonal
sulcus, its exact position in relation to the fundus differed
by approximately 1.5–2 cm.

## DISCUSSION


In the present study of Broca’s region, a new observerindependent cytoarchitectonic technique was applied for
determining areal borders. This technique has several
advantages when compared with the traditional approach
by pure visual inspection: the position and significance of
borders can be statistically tested, and the technique is
sensitive enough to detect subparcellations of cortical
areas.
Afew cytoarchitectonic borders, e.g., between the somatosensory cortex and the primary motor cortex and between
the primary and secondary visual areas, are obvious and
can be clearly defined by pure visual inspection. For these
borders, discrepancies between different observers are
marginal. However, the cytoarchitecture of the vast majority of cytoarchitectonic areas does not differ this distinctly
(‘‘homotypical isocortex’’ of Brodmann). Moreover, cytoar

chitectonic features can change gradually at the transition
between two areas. A well-known example is the gradual
disappearance of giant pyramidal cells at the border
between Brodmann’s areas 4 and 6. Such cases led to the
definition of ‘‘transitional areas’’that share common cytoarchitectonic features with neighboring areas. One transitional area has been described at the border between
prefrontal area 9 and area 45 (Rajkowska and GoldmanRakic, 1995b). The observer-independent procedure localizes the precise position of the border even in such cases
because the definition of borders is based on single and
significant peaks in the multivariate distance function.
This procedure allows one to identify a transitional area as
a distinct cytoarchitectonic unit with reproducibly definable borders. A similar statistical approach is widely used
in functional imaging studies because clusters of activation are considered meaningful only if there are significant
differences between signal and ‘‘noise’’ (Roland, 1993;
Cherry and Phelps, 1996; Friston, 1996). Moreover, the
analysis of cell density profiles in a transition area makes
it possible to objectively define the degree of similarity
between the cytoarchitecture of the transition area and the
surrounding areas. The transition area may then be
clearly classified according to the similarity criterion as a
subarea of one of the neighboring areas.


## Methodologic considerations

The multivariate distance function between groups of
profiles was calculated to quantify the degree of differences

in laminar distribution patterns between areas. Previous
studies have shown that the Mahalanobis distance is
superior to other distance measures, e.g., the Euclidean
distance (Schleicher et al., 1995, 1998). It is possible to
apply the method to all structures with a lamination
pattern and, therefore, is not limited to the human cerebral cortex. The method can also be applied for identifying
borders in chemo- and myeloarchitectonic specimens
(Jansen et al., 1996). The analysis of the distance function
shows local but not long-term shifts in architecture
(Schleicher et al., 1998). The sharp and not gradually
changing character of myeloarchitectonic borders of the
inferior frontal gyrus had been established (Vogt and Vogt,
1919) and was subsequently confirmed for cytoarchitecture (Riegele, 1931).
The application of the automated delineation procedure
in most cases showed borders of areas 44 and 45 at
positions that were in good agreement with results obtained by pure visual inspection. In other cases, borders
could not be reliably and convincingly defined by visual
inspection. The present approach provided reproducible
and statistically significant borders even in these cases.
The application of the automated delineation procedure
requires very homogeneous staining of high contrast,
which is achieved with the silver-staining technique used
in our laboratory. Small artifacts, as illustrated in some of
the figures, did not result in ‘‘artificial’’ borders. However,
even if large artifacts cause ‘‘artificial’’ peaks on the
distance function, statistically significant peaks are inter

preted as cytoarchitectonic borders only if they occur in
adjacent sections. A staining artifact, a rupture of the
tissue, or a large blood vessel may distort the distance
function in one section but do not appear over many
sections.
To apply the automated procedure, it is necessary that
the histologic sections contain the entire ROI. Ideally, the
plane of sectioning should not be too oblique. In the case of
gyrificated brains, it is inevitable that some parts of the
ROI are obliquely sectioned. Although this condition must
also be fulfilled in classic cytoarchitectonic studies, it is an
important methodologic result that our automated delineation was relatively resistant to variations in sectioning
planes. It was found that cortical thickness in oblique
planes should not be more than two to three times larger
than if the same area had been sectioned exactly parallel
to the cell columns. It is clear that no delineation can be
achieved either by visual inspection or with the automated
method when not all cortical layers are present in a
section, e.g., when the fundus of a sulcus or the crown of a
gyrus is cut tangentially.

Fig. 13. Asymmetry coefficient (AC, %) of overall density of cell
bodies (gray level index) collapsed over all cortical layers in areas 44
and 45 of male (lower half) and female (upper half) brains.All five male
brains showed a left-larger-than-right asymmetry in area 44. By
contrast, the ACs for females in area 44 and for both sexes in area 45
were more evenly distributed, i.e., no interhemispheric asymmetry
could be detected in these cases.

such differences were found when the profiles of both areas
were compared for the whole sample because high intersubject variability smoothed the cytoarchitectonic differences
between the areas. In addition, the cytoarchitecture of
both areas is rather similar. Common cytoarchitectonic
features of areas 44 and 45 include prominent pyramidal
cells in deep layer III and in layer V, the lack of a clear
border between layers II and III, and the low cell density in
layer VI. Areas 44 and 45 can be distinguished mainly
because layer IV in area 45 is relatively more distinct than
that of ‘‘dysgranular’’ area 44 (Riegele, 1931). Our analysis
of relative layer thickness in both areas supports this
statement. Layer IV was relatively thinner in area 44
despite our definition of layer IV, which included some
invading pyramidal cells from layers III and V. This
difference was statistically significant.

Intersubject variability in human brain anatomy is
influenced by factors such as heredity, gender, age, brain
size and shape, life history, clinical history, cause of death,
and autopsy conditions (Vierordt, 1893; Blinkov and Glezer,
1968; Haug, 1980; Skullerud, 1985). Variability in structure may contribute to variability in speech production
and to the intensity of a deficit or recovery after stroke
(Mohr, 1973). Economo and Koskinas (1925) noted pronounced intersubject variability in the microstructure,
e.g., in the size of the large pyramidal cells in deep layer III
and their presence in area FCBm. The clarity of the
borders of Broca’s region to areas of the middle frontal
gyrus also differed (Economo and Koskinas, 1925). Intersubject differences in the sizes of areas 44 and 45 were also
described (Kononova, 1935; 1949). In the present analysis,
we compared the differences in cytoarchitecture between
the homologous areas in different individuals (intersubject
variability) with the differences between them in each
single case (interareal variability). Intersubject differences between areas 44 and between areas 45 were larger
than intrasubject differences between areas 44 and 45 in
each individual brain. One may argue that shrinkage
affected the brains to different degrees during histologic
procedures and may have influenced absolute cell density
and thus the profiles. However, the GLI is not a measure of
absolute cell density; it is a ratio describing the volume
proportion occupied by cell bodies in a certain volume of
cortical tissue. Therefore, the GLI is not influenced by
shrinkage if both major compartments (cell bodies and
neuropil) shrink to the same or nearly the same degree.
Maximal differences in shrinkage between the gray matter
(containing relatively more cell bodies than fibers) and the
white matter (containing relatively fewer cell bodies and
more fibers) of only 9% has been reported (Kretschmann et
al., 1982). Thus, differential shrinkage cannot explain high
intersubject variability.
Intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture was accompanied by intersubject variability in the positions of areas 44
and 45 relative to sulci and gyri. We found that one and the
same cytoarchitectonic border was located in a sulcal
fundus in some hemispheres but on one or the other wall of
the sulcus or at the top of a gyrus in others. Distances from
the fundus of up to 1.5–2 cm were observed. The spatial
variability of borders relative to macroscopic features
therefore is a relevant factor for the architectonic interpretation of functional imaging studies with a spatial resolution of a few millimeters. The classic maps do not provide
information concerning the position of borders in the
depths of a sulcus. Kononova (1938) found areal borders of
areas 44 and 45 that did not coincide with the fundus of a
sulcus. In some sections, area 45 does not reach the
inferior frontal sulcus; in other sections, area 45 occupies
parts of the dorsal wall of the middle frontal gyrus
(Kononova, 1938).
In addition, there is great variability among the smaller
but important sulci of the inferior frontal gyrus (Ono et al.,
1990; Duvernoy, 1991; Kretschmann and Weinrich, 1996).
For example, the diagonal sulcus and the triangular sulci
may or may not be present, and the courses of the
horizontal and ascending branches of the lateral fissure
may differ. There are pronounced individual differences in
the continuity or discontinuity of the inferior frontal
sulcus and the courses of the precentral sulcus (Ono et al.,
1990; Duvernoy, 1991). Furthermore, we found that the
diagonal sulcus can either be located within area 44 or

area has been reported for the horizontal branch of the
lateral fissure and its relationship to area 45 (Kononova,


lines above the abscissa. Roman numerals, numbers of layers. In
contrast to the situation shown in Figure 3, the shapes of profiles
obtained from areas 44 and 45 seem to be similar when averaged over
the entire sample.

areas of the opercular part of the inferior frontal gyrus
may be shifted with respect to a certain sulcus by one

Left and right hemispheres of case 8. B: Left and right hemispheres of

location of a cytoarchitectonic area precisely based on
macroscopic landmarks.
This variability of cytoarchitectonic areas can be interpreted as class 1 variability that is not predictable from
visible landmarks (Rademacher et al., 1993). In contradistinction, class 2 variability is predictable from visible
landmarks. A prevalence of class 2 variability was found in
four primary cortical areas, i.e., these areas were found to
bear a characteristic relationship to a set of landmarks.
Therefore, the landmarks that frame these fields may be a
more reliable basis for functional imaging than referring
to a stereotactic system (Rademacher et al., 1993). However, areas 44 and 45 do not belong to primary areas. They

did not show this close relationship to sulci in the present
sample. Thus, landmark-based anatomic interpretations
of functional data of Broca’s region are possible only in
those particular cases in which foci of activation match the
free surfaces of the opercular and/or triangular parts.
Interpretations become more and more inaccurate the
smaller the distance to a ‘‘bordering’’ sulcus.
The present study has demonstrated the presence of
parcellations within areas 44 and 45. Thus, neither area
seems to be completely homogeneous cytoarchitectonically.
Subdivisions of areas 44 and 45 have been described in the
past but have not been systematically examined. Economo
and Koskinas (1925) recognized a ‘‘campus anterior’’ and
‘‘campus posterior’’ in area 44, which were separated by


-----

the diagonal sulcus. The anterior part had a thinner
cortex, fewer pyramidal cells in layer IIIc, and a paler
layer Vb than did the posterior part. This anterior–
posterior divergence in cytoarchitecture, with the diagonal
sulcus as an internal border, was corroborated in subsequent independent studies (Kononova, 1935, 1949). However, this subdivision of area 44 requires the presence of
the diagonal sulcus, which is not found in all brains.
Several cytoarchitectonic subdivisions have been found
within area 45 (Kononova, 1949). Myeloarchitectonic
(Petrides and Pandya, 1994) and pigment-architectonic
observations (Braak, 1979) also have described possible
subdivisions within areas 44 and 45 (Vogt, 1910). Similar
subdivision of areas 44 and 45 have been found in Macaca
_mulatta (Petrides and Pandya, 1994). However, it is still_
under discussion as to which cortical areas are the homologues of human areas 44 and 45 in the monkey (Lieberman, 1985; Barbas and Pandya, 1987; Aboitiz and Garcia,
1997; Rizzolatti and Arbib, 1998). Of the areas composing
Broca’s region, only area 45 has been confirmed by Preuss
and Goldman-Rakic (1991).
Functional imaging studies in man also have provided
some evidence concerning a subparcellation of both areas.
Positron emission tomography during different tasks of
phonetic processing have shown cortical activations that
were probably located in a posterior and superior subregion of area 44 near the border with area 6 but not in the
inferior part of area 44 (Zatorre et al., 1996).Another study
found a cluster of cortical activation in the most posterior
and ventral subregion of area 44 (Amunts et al., 1998). In
conclusion, architectonic and functional data strongly suggest that areas 44 and 45 are heterogeneous. The systematic anatomic mapping of these subareas and an analysis
of their functional significance require further detailed
studies.

## Anatomic left–right and gender differences in Broca’s region


In contrast to a large number of reports on structural
asymmetries in the posterior speech region, i.e., in Wernicke’s area (Flechsig, 1920; Pfeifer, 1920; Economo and
Horn, 1930; Geschwind and Levitsky, 1968; Witelson and
Pallie, 1973; Sanides, 1975; Chi et al., 1977; Galaburda
and Geschwind, 1981; Galaburda et al., 1987; Steinmetz et
al., 1991; Witelson and Kigar, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1993b;
Jacobs and Scheibel, 1993; Schlaug et al., 1995a; Anderson
and Rutledge, 1996; Ide et al., 1996; Penhune et al., 1996;
Steinmetz, 1996), such asymmetries in the anterior speech
region have only rarely been examined. For review, see
Uylings et al. (1999).
The present study has shown interhemispheric differences in the GLI for area 44. The GLI was higher on the
left than on the right. This finding indicates that there was
more space between cell bodies (i.e., the neuropil) in the
right than in the left area 44. Corresponding left–right
differences have been described for dendrites that form a
major part of the neuropil; a greater total dendritic length
per neuron was found in the right than in the left Broca
area (Jacobs et al., 1993a). The right opercular region
showed longer lower-order dendritic segments than did
the left opercular region (Scheibel, 1984). In contrast to
area 44, we did not find any significant left–right differences in GLI in area 45. This lack of asymmetry is
compatible with other reports. For example, the sizes of
magnopyramidal cell bodies in area 45 were similar for


both hemispheres, and only the largest magnopyramidal
cells of layer III were found to be larger on the left than on
the right (Hayes and Lewis, 1995, 1996).
The present study has also shown that differences in
GLI between the left and right areas 44 seem to be gender
dependent. Whereas the GLI, which is a good estimate of
cell packing density (Wree et al., 1982), was consistently
higher on the left in all male brains, only three of five
female brains showed this asymmetry. Other anatomic
gender differences in Broca’s region have been reported.
The volume of a region roughly corresponding to the
opercular, triangular, and orbital parts were found to differ
between male and female brains, but side differences were
not detectable (Harasty et al., 1997). An MR imaging study
has shown a higher percentage of gray matter ventral to
the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex in women than in men,
but it did not examine left–right differences (Schlaepfer et
al., 1995). Male brains tended to have a more distinctly
asymmetric sulcal pattern in the posterior part of the
Sylvian fissure but not in the anterior part including
Broca’s region (Witelson and Kigar, 1992). Gender differences in the functional lateralization of language have
been found in both lesion and functional imaging studies
(McGlone, 1980; Kimura, 1983; Hier et al., 1994; Pedersen
et al., 1995; Shaywitz et al., 1995). The study by Shaywitz
et al. (1995) has shown that brain activation of the inferior
frontal gyrus during particular phonological tasks is more
lateralized in male than in female brains. However, it is
still an open question as to whether these side differences
can be assigned to area 44, area 45, or both.
The interhemispheric differences in the volume of area
44 appear to be greater than those in cytoarchitecture. A
left-over-right asymmetry was detected in all 10 cases.
This finding supports an that of a previous study in which
a significantly larger area 44 was found on the left than on
the right (Galaburda, 1980). Nine of the 10 subjects of that
study had a larger area 44 on the left side. If the present
sample is combined with that in the study by Galaburda,
the incidence of leftward asymmetry (19 of 20 cases, 95%)
matches the frequency of left-sided speech dominance in
the general population (Branche et al., 1964) and may
structurally reflect the functional lateralization (Steinmetz et al., 1991; Annett and Alexander, 1996). In the
present study, no consistent left–right difference in the
volume of area 45 was found. Five cases showed left-overright asymmetry and the other right-over-left asymmetry.
The degree of asymmetry (without considering sides) did
not differ significantly between the two areas. Thus, area
45 is not more symmetric than area 44; it is more heterogeneous pertaining to the direction of asymmetry. The data
on volumes of areas 44 and 45 also clearly showed that the
variability of this parameter and of the total brain weights
(and, thus, brain volumes) are considerable. Because a
preliminary ontogenetic study in six female and five male
brains indicated a left-over-right asymmetry in the volume
of area 45 in the male group (Uylings et al., 1999), further
studies on a larger number of male and female subjects is
needed to show the pattern of asymmetry in area 45.
In previous studies on asymmetry, the sulcal patterns
were used to mark the border of the speech region (Stengel, 1930). A left-over-right asymmetry was found when
both extra- and intrasulcal parts of the cortex were
combined (Falzi et al., 1982). A similar asymmetry was
found in the pars triangularis (Albanese et al., 1989;
Foundas et al., 1995).


-----

**AREAS 44 AND 45** **339**


In conclusion, the asymmetry we found in the cytoarchitecture and volume of area 44 could well be the structural
correlate of speech lateralization. Area 45 seems to be less
lateralized. Area 44, but not 45, was also asymmetric with
respect to cell packing density, and this feature differed
between genders. We have shown that, because both the
sulcal pattern and the cytoarchitectonic borders of Broca’s
region are highly and independently variable, areas 44
and 45 cannot be reliably and precisely localized on the
basis of contours seen in MR images. There are regions,
i.e., the free surfaces of the triangular and opercular parts,
in which the probability is very high of localizing areas 45
and 44, respectively. However, the smaller the distance to
surrounding sulci, the greater the probability of finding
areas other than these. Thus, anatomic interpretation
becomes much more accurate when images containing
functionally characterized areas are warped into atlases
containing 3-D representations of cytoarchitectonically
mapped areas because these atlases may quantify the
probability of localizing a specific area at a given stereotaxic position (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996, 1998; Zilles
et al., 1995). Three-dimensional probability maps of areas
44 and 45 can be applied for analyzing the role of Broca’s
region in speech and in functions that are different from
speech (Amunts et al., 1998).
