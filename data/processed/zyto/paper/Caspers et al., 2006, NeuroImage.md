The inferior parietal cortex (IPC) integrates information from
different sensory modalities and plays an important role in a variety
of higher cognitive functions. Brodmann (Brodmann, K., 1909.
Vergleichende Lokalisationslehre der Großhirnrinde. Barth, Leipzig)
proposed a cytoarchitectonic subdivision of the IPC into only two
cortical areas, a rostral (BA 40) and a caudal (BA 39) area.
Although his scheme was repeatedly challenged by other observers, it
is still used for the anatomical localization of functional imaging data.
The apparent differences between all these cyto- and myeloarchitectonic maps may be caused partly by the observer-dependent
procedure of defining cytoarchitectonic borders by pure visual
inspection of histological sections and partly by the interindividual
variability of cytoarchitecture. The present observations and the
resulting cortical map of the IPC are based on quantitative, observerindependent definitions of cytoarchitectonic borders and take into
account each area's topographical variability across brains. Ten
human postmortem brains were scanned using an MRI 3-D FLASH
sequence prior to histological processing. After embedding in
paraffin, serial sections through whole brains were prepared, and
the sections were stained for cell bodies. Following high-resolution
digitization of sections containing the IPC, we defined the cytoarchitecture and borders of each cortical area of this brain region using a
multivariate statistical analysis of laminar cell density profiles. In
contrast to previous observations, we found seven cytoarchitectonic
areas in the IPC: five in the rostral (covering the region of BA 40)
and two in the caudal part (covering the region of BA 39). We
observed considerable interindividual variability in the topography of
each area. A consistent correspondence between macroanatomical
landmarks and cytoarchitectonic borders was not found. This new
cytoarchitectonic map of the human IPC demonstrates regional
differences in the cortical microstructure that is suggestive of
functional differentiation. Furthermore, the map is registered in

Introduction

The inferior parietal cortex (IPC) integrates various modalities
(e.g., somatosensory, visual, and auditory) and plays an important
role in various higher cognitive functions. One may wonder
whether this functional complexity is reflected at a structural (e.g.,
cytoarchitectonic) level.
According to Brodmann (1909; Fig. 1A), the IPC consists of
two different cytoarchitectonic areas: BA 40 located on the
supramarginal gyrus and BA 39 on the angular gyrus. Rostrally,
BA 40 borders the somatosensory cortex (BA 2). Ventrally, BA 40
reaches into the depth of the operculum Rolandi and dorsally to the
intraparietal sulcus. The ventral part of BA 39 abuts the temporal
cortex. The caudal part of BA 39 borders the occipital cortex.
Other cyto- or myeloarchitectonic maps of this cortical region
have been published by Campbell (1905), Vogt and Vogt (1919;
Fig. 1B), von Economo and Koskinas (1925; Figs. 1C and D),
Gerhardt (1940), Bailey and von Bonin (1951), Sarkissov et al.
(1955; Fig. 1E), and Batsch (1956). None of these maps, however,
takes into account the interindividual variability of the cortical
areas, especially with respect to size and their positions relative to
macroscopical landmarks. Furthermore, the maps were published
as schematic drawings. Thus, a volume or surface based reference
system, which provides the opportunity to import and spatially
normalize structural or functional data from other brains, is
missing. A third problem is the observer-dependent method of
classical cytoarchitectonic studies. As a consequence, the maps are

strongly influenced by each investigator’s criteria for defining
microstructural borders between cortical areas. This led to
considerable differences between the maps. For example, in sharp
contrast to Brodmann (1909), von Economo and Koskinas (1925)
subdivided BA 40 into five areas.


In the present study, the borders of cytoarchitectonic areas were
delineated in 10 postmortem brains using an observer-independent
technique (Schleicher et al., 1999; Zilles et al., 2002). The brains
and areas were then spatially normalized to the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) single reference brain, and a


-----

probability map was generated for each area by superimposing the
data from all ten brains. An area's probability map reflects the
interindividual variability of this area with respect to size and
location since a single voxel in MNI space represents the frequency
of the representation of parts of this particular area found in one up
to ten brains. Following normalization, the 3-D cytoarchitectonic
probability maps can be co-registered and compared with
functional MRI or PET data in the same reference space (Eickhoff
et al., 2005).
This probabilistic and observer-independent procedures have
already successfully applied in studies of the somatosensory (BA
3a, 3b, 1: Geyer et al., 1999; BA 2: Grefkes et al., 2001), motor
(BA 4: Geyer et al., 1996), and premotor cortex (BA 6: Geyer,
2004), Broca’s speech region (BA 44 and 45: Amunts et al., 1999),
primary auditory cortex (BA 41: Morosan et al., 2001), visual
cortex (BA 17 and 18: Amunts et al., 2000), and, most recently, the
parietal operculum (Eickhoff et al., 2006a,b) and areas hIP1 and
hIP2 in the intraparietal sulcus (Choi et al., 2006).
In the present study, we used the same methodical approach to
study the cytoarchitectonic organization of the IPC. We found a
mosaic of seven areas: five are located on the supramarginal gyrus,
two lie on the angular gyrus.

Materials and methods

Histology and MR scanning of postmortem brains

We analyzed ten postmortem brains (5 males, 5 females,
ranging in age from 37 to 86 years, cf. Table 1) obtained through
the body donor program of the Department of Anatomy, University
of Düsseldorf, Germany. Subjects had no known history of
neurological or psychiatric diseases. We removed the brains from
the skull and fixed them for approximately 5 months in 4%
formaldehyde diluted in water or in Bodian's fixative (90 ml of
80% ethanol, 5 ml of 37% formaldehyde diluted in water, and 5 ml
of glacial acetic acid). During fixation, the brains were suspended
on the basilar artery to avoid compression or distortions. After
fixation, we scanned each brain with a T1-weighted MR sequence
(1.5 T Siemens Magnetom SP scanner, 3-D fast low angle shot
(3-D FLASH) pulse sequence, flip angle=40°, TR=40 ms,
TE=5 ms, voxel size=1.17 mm (x)×1 mm (y)×1 mm (z)) in
order to document brain size and shape before subsequent
histological processing. We dehydrated the brains in graded
alcohols, embedded them in paraffin, and sectioned them in a
coronal plane using a large-scale microtome (20 μm thick serial
whole-brain sections, Fig. 2A). While sectioning the brain, we
obtained blockface images after each 60th section with a CCD
camera (XC-75, Sony, Japan, image matrix=256×256 pixels, 8 bit
gray value resolution). We mounted each 60th section on a gelatincoated slide and stained it for cell bodies with a modified silver

method (Merker, 1983) for observer-independent cytoarchitectonic
analysis (Fig. 2B).

Observer-independent delineation of cytoarchitectonic borders

In each cell-stained section, we defined a rectangular region of
interest (ROI) which encompassed the supramarginal or angular
gyrus (Fig. 2B) and scanned each ROI in a meander-like sequence
with a CCD camera (XC-75, Sony, Japan) and a microscope
(Universal, Zeiss, Germany) equipped with a computer-controlled
motorized stage. The obtained images (736×544 μm each) of a
ROI were further processed with an image analysis software
package (KS 400, Zeiss, Germany) to determine the volume
fraction of darkly stained cell bodies (gray level index GLI) after
adaptive thresholding (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990). GLI values
were measured in square, adjacent measuring fields, each
16×16 μm wide. The final data matrix covering the entire ROI
is visualized as a GLI image (Fig. 2C). For further details, see
Schleicher and Zilles (1990) and Zilles et al. (2002).
From each GLI image, we extracted GLI profiles running
perpendicularly to the cortical layers. To this end, we interactively
drew outer (between layer I and II) and inner (between layer VI and
the white matter) contour lines of the cerebral cortex using a
MATLAB (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA) routine. We
then extracted GLI profiles using a physical model based on electric
field lines extending between the outer and inner contour line (Jones
et al., 2000). We defined linear traverses by connecting the startand end-point of each field line (Schmitt and Böhme, 2002, 2003;
Fig. 2D) and, along each traverse, extracted the GLI values from the
digitized image. To compensate for variations in cortical thickness,
we resampled each profile with linear interpolation to a standard
length corresponding to a cortical thickness of 100%.
To quantify each profile's shape, we extracted five features
based on central moments (mean y (y =GLI), mean x (x =cortical
depth), standard deviation of x, skewness, and kurtosis) from (i) the

profile and (ii) the absolute value of its first derivative. We
combined the ten feature values into one feature vector X. In a next
step, a mean feature vector X1 from a set (block) of b adjacent
profiles (8 ≤ b ≤ 24), and another mean feature vector X2 from a
neighboring block of b adjacent profiles (8 ≤ b ≤ 24) were


calculated. The number of profiles per block (b) defines the spatial
resolution of this procedure; that is, only cytoarchitectonic entities
wider than the cortical sector sampled by one block of profiles can
be detected. The Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis et al., 1949)
was determined for each combination of mean vectors X1, X2 using

a sliding window technique and plotted as a function of the
positions of the border between these profile blocks with respect to
the cortical ribbon. The Mahalanobis distance function showed
maxima at those positions in the cortex where the profiles
maximally differed in shape representing the laminar distribution
of GLIs. We tested these maxima for statistical significance with a
Hotelling’s T[2] test and Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons (Fig. 2E). For further details, see Schleicher et al. (1999) and
Zilles et al. (2002). In most cases, we calculated the distance
functions for block sizes of b =8 to b =24 (b =number of profiles per
block) in each ROI and plotted the positions of significant maxima
as a function of b (Fig. 2F). The frequency of maxima at comparable
positions was used to define putative thresholds adequate for
detecting the specific cytoarchitectonic differences between the
actual areas under investigation. This threshold sets the sensitivity
for detecting borders; it has to be adjusted to the actual cytoarchitectonic composition of a section. In a few instances (cf. Fig. 7C—
border between PFcm and PFop), however, the cytoarchitectonic
patterns of two adjacent areas (as quantified by the GLI profiles)
differed only slightly between the areas. Obviously, in this setting,
high frequencies of maxima could be caused by artifacts, i.e., tissue
damage or tangential sectioning. The relevant cytoarchitectonic
border on the other hand will only be reflected by lower maxima
frequencies. The threshold for partitioning the cortical stripe thus
had to be adjusted to lower levels than b =8. In contrast, other
borders under investigation like the one between PGp and the
occipital lobe (Fig. 12B) were much better detectable, resulting in a
considerably higher frequency of maxima at these positions. Such
borders could, therefore, be confirmed at higher frequency levels.
This dynamical adaptation of the cut-off frequency was crucial to
ensure sufficient sensitivity of the quantitative cytoarchitectonic
analysis, while avoiding or disregarding false positive parcellations.
The location of each putative border was then followed up through
stacks of neighboring sections, and only those borders that could be
traced in a continuous representation across space were considered
in the anatomical parcellation of the IPC. Finally, the hereby defined
architectonic entities were compared with the original histological
sections by microscopical inspection for the description of cellular
characteristics as well as identification of cytoarchitectural features
and assignments as described in the literature.

3-D reconstruction of postmortem brains

To display the topography of each area on its brain’s cortical
surface, we digitized each cell-stained section with a CCD camera
(XC-75, Sony, Japan). We reconstructed each postmortem brain in
3-D (Schormann and Zilles, 1998) from (i) the images of the
paraffin blockface, (ii) the digitized histological sections, and (iii)
the brain's T1-weighted MR scan. Since the MR scan was obtained
prior to histological processing, artefacts (e.g., shrinkage of the
brain due to dehydration in graded alcohols, embedding in paraffin,
distortion of the sections due to cutting) could be eliminated in the
reconstructed volume by matching it with the MR volume of the
same brain and using linear and nonlinear correction procedures.
We labeled each area in the coronal sections of the reconstructed
volume according to the area's topography in the corresponding
cell-stained sections (Amunts et al., 1999, 2000; Eickhoff et al.,
2006a,b; Geyer et al., 1999; Geyer et al., 1996; Geyer, 2004;
Grefkes et al., 2001; Morosan et al., 2001). After smoothing with
an isotropic Gaussian kernel (full-width half-maximum (FWHM)
=1.2 mm), we rendered each brain's surface and IPC areas.


Results

The observer-independent mapping procedure

An example of the observer-independent procedure will be
given here in some detail to illustrate the cytoarchitectonic
mapping method used in the present study. Fig. 2A shows a
lateral view of one of the ten brains after fixation. A coronal wholebrain section no. 1231 (cf. vertical line in Fig. 2A) through this
brain, stained for cell bodies, is depicted in Fig. 2B. The box in
Fig. 2B marks the ROI within which GLI profiles were extracted.
The GLI image of this ROI is depicted at higher magnification in
Fig. 2C. In the GLI image, we interactively draw an outer (between
layer I and II) and inner (between layer VI and the white matter)
contour line and extracted GLI profiles running perpendicularly to
the cortical layers (Fig. 2D). The Mahalanobis distances are plotted
for two different block sizes (b =16 GLI profiles (bottom) and
b =22 GLI profiles (top)) as functions of their positions along the
cortical ribbon (Fig. 2E). Statistically significant maxima are
marked with black asterisks. Fig. 2F (top) shows the effect of
increasing values of b by processing the same set of profiles (cf.
Fig. 2D) for b =8 to b =24. Only the positions of significant
maxima are indicated (horizontal frames at b =16 and b =22
correspond to Mahalanobis curves in Fig. 2E bottom and top,
respectively). Smoothing of the distance functions increases with
higher values of b, but the positions of the maxima remain
remarkably stable. The positions of cytoarchitectonically meaningful maxima are confirmed by plotting the absolute frequencies
of the significant maxima (ordinate) against the profile position
(abscissa). In this example, those profile positions where
significant maxima occurred with frequencies above eight (dashed
horizontal line in Fig. 2F, bottom) were accepted as borders. This
threshold above eight sets the sensitivity of the mapping procedure
with respect to the number of borders detected. The threshold was
determined in such a way that comparable positions of the resulting
borders must be identifiable across stacks of neighboring sections
(criterion of anatomical consistency). This allows to minimize the
detection of false positive “borders”, i.e., borders found in only one
section. It is not an absolute threshold generally applicable
throughout the whole human neocortex, but has to be slightly
adjusted to the contrast in cytoarchitecture between the actual areas
under investigation (Figs. 7–12). For details, see Zilles et al.
(2002).
In the example given in Fig. 2, borders are located at profile
positions 78, 296, and 406. These observer-independently
identified areas and their borders (marked in Fig. 2D) were
subsequently studied by microscopic inspection of the cytoarchitectonical pattern in the histological sections. The border at profile
position 78 coincides with the cytoarchitectonical border between
area PGp and the adjoining occipital cortex (occ), the border at
profile position 296 coincides with the border between PGp and
the intraparietal sulcus (ips), and the border at profile position 406
is located within the ips.

Cytoarchitectonic features of the IPC areas

Based on the above described procedure, we defined a mosaic of
seven regions in the IPC. Five regions are located on the
supramarginal gyrus (approximately in the region of BA 40), the
other two regions are found on the angular gyrus (approximately in
the region of BA 39). As far as possible, we adopted the

nomenclature of von Economo and Koskinas (1925; cf. Figs. 1C and
D). The five regions PF, PFcm, PFm, PFop, and PFt of the
supramarginal gyrus are arranged in two rostro-caudal rows: a dorsal
row with three regions and a ventral row with two smaller regions.
On the angular gyrus, where both Brodmann (1909) and von
Economo and Koskinas (1925) found only one region (BA 39 and
area PG, respectively), we discerned one rostral (PGa) and one
caudal region (PGp).
Area PFop is located rostro-ventrally in the IPC. Its cytoarchitectonic pattern is very homogeneous (Fig. 3A). The cortical layers
are poorly separated, and the sizes of the pyramidal cells do not vary
much among the different layers. The cell density in layer II is
relatively low. There is a superficial-to-deep increase in the size of
pyramidal cells in layer III. Layer IIIc pyramids are larger than those
of layer V. Layer IV is sparsely developed, and layer V cannot be
subdivided into an upper and lower part. The border between layer
VI and the white matter is clearly visible.
Area PFt lies dorsal to PFop. Its cortical layers are separated
more clearly than those in PFop (Fig. 3B). Layer II of PFt has a
higher cell density than that of PFop. The large pyramidal cells of
lower layer III are prominent. The pyramids of layer III also


increase in size from superficial to deeper parts. The pyramids in
layer IIIc are larger than those of layer V and define a sharp border
with layer IV. Although layer IV stands out more clearly than it
does in PFop, it is also rather thin. Layer V can be subdivided into
a superficial part (layer Va) with higher cell density and a deeper
part (layer Vb) with lower cell density. Layer VI is clearly visible,
having sharp borders with layer Vb and the white matter.
Area PF, the largest region of the IPC, lies caudal to PFt. PF is
very broad, and all its layers are cell dense (Fig. 4A). Layer II is
poorly separated from upper layer III because the granular cells of
layer II intermingle with the small pyramids in upper layer III.
Layer III represents the major part of the cortical width; its
pyramidal cells have a marked superficial-to-deep increase in size.
The pyramidal cells of layer IIIc are larger than those of layer V.
Layer IV is clearly visible but is interrupted by vertical strands of
pyramidal cells which extend from deep layer III to upper layer V
(arrows in Fig. 4A). This feature leads to the impression that layer
IV consists of clusters of granular cells. The medium-sized
pyramids in layer V are evenly distributed and no sub-layers are
observed. The border between layer V and VI is difficult to
recognize. The border between layer VI and the white matter is not

as sharp as it is in areas PFop or PFt. The cells in layers IIIb
through VI exhibit a moderate columnar arrangement.
Area PFm (Fig. 4B) abuts caudally on area PF. The
cytoarchitectonic features of the anterior and posterior IPC merge
in area PFm: it may be interpreted as a transition zone between
the two cortical regions, PF and PG. The cortex of PFm is very
broad, as in area PF. Likewise, the border between layers II and
III is difficult to detect. The pyramids show a pronounced
superficial-to-deep increase in size across layer III; layer IIIc
pyramids of PFm are larger than those in area PF. The cells in
layers IIIb to VI of PFm are arranged in columns. Layer IV is
more clearly separated from layers III and V than anywhere else
in the PF region. A well demarcated layer IV can also be found in
the PG region. This common feature suggests that area PFm is a
transition zone between rostral and caudal regions of IPC.
Another common feature is the low cell density and small size of
the pyramids in layer V. It gives the impression of a light layer V,
especially in contrast to the increased cell density in layer III. The
border towards layer VI is barely recognizable, just like in area
PF. The transition between layer VI and the white matter is not
very sharp.


The fifth area of the rostral IPC is PFcm (Fig. 5). It lies in the
depths of the parietal operculum, ventral to PF and caudal to PFop.
The cortex of PFcm is narrower, and the cell density across all
layers is lower than in either PF or PFm. Layer II is narrow but can
be clearly separated from layer III. Large pyramids in lower layer
III are a conspicuous feature of PFcm, as they are in PFt. Both
areas differ also with respect to the columnar arrangement of the
cell bodies. A distinct columnar arrangement is found in PFcm,
extending from layer III through VI. Layer IV is sparsely
developed. In layer V, there is no subdivision into upper and
lower sub-layers. The layer VI/white matter border is very sharp.
The caudal IPC region begins occipital to PFm. It consists of
two areas, a rostral (PGa) and a caudal (PGp) area.
In PGa (Fig. 6A), the very prominent layer IV is shifted to a
more superficial position and subdivides the cortex into two
equally wide bands, one above and one below layer IV. These are
the general cytoarchitectonic features which separate the caudal
from the rostral IPC region. Further characteristics of area PGa
include a very narrow layer II, an abrupt increase in the sizes of
pyramidal cells from superficial to deep layer III, a low cell density
in layer V, a relatively dark layer VI (reflecting its higher cell

density), which can be clearly separated from layer V, and an
indistinct border between layer VI and the white matter.
The caudal area, PGp (Fig. 6B), has a slightly broader layer II
than area PGa. Its granular cells intermingle with the small
pyramids in upper layer III so that the border between layers II and
III is difficult to identify. Layer III appears fairly homogeneous


with a minor superficial-to-deep increase in pyramidal cell size.
Layer IV shifts to a deeper position in the cortex, making layer III
wider than it is in PGa. As in PGa, layer IV is clearly visible. Layer
V has a very low cell density and appears as a light stripe between
the darker layers IV and VI. Cell density in layer VI is not as high
as in PGa. The layer VI/white matter border is sharp.

Borders between the IPC areas

The rostralmost areas of the IPC are PFop and PFt. PFop is
located on the dorsal shoulder of the lateral fissure between the


operculum Rolandi and the free surface of the IPC where it has a
common border with area PFt (Fig. 7A). From PFt to PFop, the
cortex becomes more homogeneous, larger pyramidal cells appear

between layer VI and the white matter becomes more blurred.
PFop has a common border with area OP4 (Eickhoff et al., 2006a,
b) of the parietal operculum (Fig. 7B). At the transition from PFop


to OP4, the cortex thickness decreases, the pyramidal cells in lower
layer III increase in size, and a columnar arrangement of the cells
in layers III to V becomes apparent. This border can be confirmed

with the observer-independent technique and is found at profile
position no. 60 in Fig. 7B. PFop also has a common border with
caudally adjacent area PFcm (Fig. 7C). From PFop to PFcm, the
cortex thins, the layers are more clearly separated, upper layer III
lightens because of decreased cell packing density, and lower layer
III has larger pyramidal cells. This border is confirmed at profile
no. 59 (Fig. 7C).
Area PFt is a small region dorsal to PFop. PFt occupies the
rostralmost sector of the IPC and separates it from somatosensory
area BA 2 (Grefkes et al., 2001). BA 2 is characterized by big
pyramids in lower layer III and a distinct layer V which appears
light between the cell dense layers IV and VI. This transition is
shown in Fig. 8A where the statistical method confirms the border
at profile no. 45. The big pyramids in lower layer III of BA2
disappear in PFt, layer II becomes more cell dense, and larger layer
V pyramidal cells are visible. Ventrally, PFt has a common border
with PFop. Area PFt lies rostral to PF. The border between PFt and
PF coincides with profile position no. 60 in Fig. 8B. In contrast to
area PFt, the layers in PF are not clearly separable.
PF covers the major part of the supramarginal gyrus. When the
rostro-caudal extent of the Sylvian fissure is short, area PF reaches
to the superior temporal gyrus. PF is surrounded by PFt rostrally,
PFcm ventrally, and PFm caudally. The border between PF and


PFm (Fig. 8C) does not correlate with macroanatomical landmarks.
The observer-independent algorithm detects this border at profile
position no. 52. From PF to PFm, the separation of the layers
becomes more obvious, layer IV more pronounced, layer V lighter,
and the overall cell packing is denser.
The border between PF and PFcm is shown in Fig. 9A. In most
hemispheres, this border is found at the shoulder of the parietal
operculum. The cortex of PFcm narrows, the contrast between
layer IV and its adjacent layers III and V increases, and layer V
becomes lighter (cf. profile position no. 58).
Area PFm abuts rostrally on PF (see above), dorsally on the
ventral intraparietal (hIP1; Choi et al., 2006) area in the
intraparietal sulcus (IPS), and caudally on PGa. The transition
between PFm and hIP1 can be found in Fig. 9B at position no. 72.
Across this border, overall cell density decreases and layers III
through V become lighter. In hIP1, medium-sized pyramids are in
lower layer III, whereas upper layer III is cell sparse.
The most important border in the IPC is the transition between
its rostral and caudal part, i.e., the transition between area PFm and
PGa (Fig. 10A). This position (no. 42) coincides with obvious
changes in cytoarchitecture. From PFm to PGa, layer IV becomes
more prominent and shifts from the deepest third to the middle of
the cortical width. Furthermore, in layer III, there is a sudden

increase in cell size between its upper and lower part. There is no
macroanatomical structure that can be used as an approximate
landmark for this border.
The most caudo-ventral region of the rostral IPC, area PFcm, is
surrounded dorsally by PF, rostrally by PFop, and medially by OP1


(Eickhoff et al., 2006a,b). The borders with PFop and PF have
been described above. The border between PFcm and OP1 is
shown in Fig. 10B. The observer-independent algorithm detects
this border at profile position no. 54 which coincides with visible
changes in microstructure. The cortex of OP1 is thicker and

contains larger layer IIIc pyramids than PFcm. This border lies in
the depth of the parietal operculum between its middle and
innermost (towards the insula) third.
Area PGa and PGp have common borders with the cortical
areas of the intraparietal sulcus (IPS) dorsally and the occipital lobe
ventrally. The PGa/IPS and PGp/IPS borders are shown in Figs.
10C and 11A, respectively. In Fig. 10C, profile position no. 38
indicates the border between PGa and the IPS cortex. Layer V is
lighter in IPS than in PGa. In Fig. 11A, profile position no. 48
indicates the border between PGp and the IPS. The cortex of IPS
narrows and the cells of layer III increase in size. In most brains,
these two borders are located at or close to the lateral shoulder of
the IPS. In some cases, particularly regarding the PGa/IPS
transition, the border is also found on the free cortical surface,
particularly when the IPS consists of two separated branches.
The border between the two areas of the caudal IPC, areas PGa
and PGp, is shown in Fig. 11B. The border at profile position no.
61 coincides with obvious cytoarchitectonic changes. In PGp, the
cells in all layers are smaller than those in PGa, and layer Vappears
lighter in PGa than PGp. This border is located in the angular


sulcus which is the continuation of the superior temporal sulcus
into the caudal part of the IPC.
The transitions between PGa and PGp and the occipital lobe
(Occ) are shown in Figs. 12A and B, respectively. The cortex of
Occ is relatively narrower and has larger pyramidal cells than
PGp in lower layer III and layer V. These differences in
pyramidal cell sizes are more pronounced at the border with PGp
than with PGa. The large pyramids of layer III are characteristic
for the “occipital cortex” type as described by von Economo and
Koskinas (1925). These observations are confirmed by the
observer-independent algorithm (PGa/Occ border at profile
position no. 61 (Fig. 12A) and PGp/Occ border at profile
position no. 69 (Fig. 12B)).
As an example, Fig. 13 shows the parcellation of the anterior IPC
in eleven coronal MRI sections through a right hemisphere of the
same brain as used in Figs. 2–12. The areas of the anterior IPC
(correspondent to BA 40) as well as adjacent areas like OP1, and
OP2 (Eickhoff et al., 2006a,b), BA2 (Grefkes et al., 2001) and hIP2
(Choi et al., 2006) extend into prominent sulci like the postcentral
(poc), intraparietal sulcus (ips) and the Sylvian fissure (Sf).

Topographical variability of the IPC areas

To display each area's topography on the cortex, we
reconstructed the ten brains in 3-D and rendered the IPC areas
on the cortical surfaces of the brains. Specifically, we wanted to
know whether the IPC areas have a consistent topographical
arrangement, and if so, to what extent the arrangement varies
between hemispheres and brains.

Fig. 14 shows as representative examples the parietal part of
five brains (left and right lateral views). In all ten brains, the
cytoarchitectonic areas are arranged in a topologically comparable
pattern; i.e., in two parallel rostro-caudal sequences: three dorsal
areas (PFt, PF, and PFm) and two smaller ventral areas (PFop and
PFcm). PGa and PGp are found farther caudally (corresponding to
the approximate position of BA 39). Again, a consistent pattern is
obvious: PGa occupies always the rostral and PGp the caudal part
of BA 39.
However, we also noticed variations in position and extent of
the areas both between individuals and between hemispheres of the


same brain. A striking example is area PFcm. In most cases, it is
found in the upper bank of the Sylvian fissure. In some brains (e.g.,
in Fig. 14A, right hemisphere, and B, both hemispheres), however,
PFcm extends onto the free surface of the parietal operculum.
Alternatively (e.g., Fig. 14A, left hemisphere), PFcm is entirely
buried in the depths of the Sylvian fissure and not visible on the
exposed parietal surface. Another example is the ventral border of
area PF with the superior temporal gyrus. In some cases (e.g., Figs.
14A and B, right hemispheres), the ventral part of PF occupies the
caudal end of the superior temporal gyrus, whereas in other cases
(e.g., Figs. 14C and B, left hemispheres), it does not.
No macroanatomical landmark reliably marks a cytoarchitectonic border between any of the IPC areas.

Discussion

The IPC was repeatedly parcellated during the last century
(Bailey and von Bonin, 1951; Batsch, 1956; Brodmann, 1909;
Campbell, 1905; Gerhardt, 1940; Sarkissov et al., 1955; Vogt

hemispheres are shown in the left column, right hemispheres in the right column. Area PFcm is not visible in all hemispheres from lateral viewpoint because
major parts of it are hidden in the Sylvian fissure. Note that there is no correspondence between macroanatomical landmarks and cytoarchitectonic borders. c:

and Vogt, 1919; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). Each map,
however, is a schematic drawing of the macro- and microanatomical topography of only one brain, and each investigator
employed criteria for defining borders between different cortical
areas, which are dependent on the experience and pattern
recognition capabilities of the observer. This produced IPC maps
that differ from each other in many aspects.
Using a reproducible observer-independent methodology, we
produced a new IPC map that accounts for interindividual
variability, avoids non-testable judgments about microstructural
borders, and produces a 3-D registered map, which can be
aligned with data from functional imaging studies.

Cytoarchitecture of the IPC

Brodmann (1909) described two areas in the IPC: rostral BA 40
on the supramarginal gyrus and caudal BA 39 on the angular gyrus.
According to Brodmann, BA 40 reaches rostro-caudally from
somatosensory area BA 2 to the Jenssen sulcus (primary
intermediate sulcus). Using the Jenssen sulcus as a border between
BA 40 and BA 39, we cannot support this finding because the
presence of this sulcus is highly variable. When the primary
intermediate sulcus is present, the transition between PFm and PGa
lies in its depth. In all other cases, the transition is either on the free
cortical surface or in the depth of an unnamed sulcus, which cannot
be identified as Jenssen sulcus according to Ono et al. (1990).
Dorso-ventrally BA 40 reaches from the IPS into the depths of
the parietal operculum towards the insular cortex. Opercular parts
of BA 40 are, however, covered by areas OP1 and OP2 (Eickhoff
et al., 2006a,b). The remaining opercular sector of BA 40 matches
our areas PFop and PFcm. PFop is found between the rostral
operculum and the free IPC surface. PFcm lies in the caudal
operculum and extends from the insula and retroinsular region to
the free IPC surface. The free IPC surface of BA 40 coincides with
our areas PFt, PF, and PFm (taking into account that the Jenssen
sulcus cannot be found in every brain).
Caudal to area PFm, the cytoarchitecture changes, indicating
the appearance of BA 39, which correlates with our areas PGa and
PGp. PGa and PGp extend from the IPS to the temporo-occipital
junction (PGa) and from the IPS to the occipital lobe (PGp).

von Economo and Koskinas (1925) segregated six areas in
their detailed description of the IPC. Five of the six areas
approximately match the position of BA 40, the sixth area
coincides roughly with a rostral part of BA 39. Our map is
more similar to the map of von Economo and Koskinas (1925)
than that of Brodmann (1909). We found a set of seven areas in
the IPC: five areas are located approximately in the region of
BA 40 and are roughly comparable with areas PFop, PFt, PF,
PFm and PFcm of von Economo and Koskinas (1925). In
contrast to von Economo and Koskinas, we found two areas in
BA 39, i.e., PGa and PGp.

von Economo and Koskinas (1925) described area PFt as a
narrow cortical band with light layers III and V, well developed
layers IV and VI, and a discrete columnar arrangement of the cells
(more pronounced on the free cortical surface, less so in the walls
of the sulci). These cytoarchitectonic features as well as the
localization as the most rostro-dorsal region of the IPC fit well with
our observations.
Area PFop is not described explicitly by von Economo and
Koskinas (1925). They mention only that PFop is similar to PFt
and extends onto the operculum Rolandi. PFop, as we define it,


only partially overlaps with the similarly named PFop of von
Economo and Koskinas (1925) and is the caudo-lateral part of
their PFop. The rest is opercular cortex, OP1–OP3 (Eickhoff et
al., 2006a,b). As the cytoarchitecture of our area PFop differs
from that of PFt, we define PFop as a separate region.
Area PF is the main rostral IPC region in the von Economo
and Koskinas (1925) map. Its prominent cytoarchitectonic
features are the rather homogeneous size and distribution of
the cells with a fine columnar arrangement, small cells in all
layers, a superficial-to-deep increase in the size of the pyramids
in layer III, and well developed layers II and IV. We
corroborated these criteria as well as von Economo's and
Koskinas's observation that area PF is very large and its ventral
part reaches to the superior temporal gyrus.
von Economo’s and Koskinas’s area PFm has larger pyramidal
cells in deep layer III and lies caudal to area PF. We could
corroborate these observations but found additional cytoarchitectonic features which are characteristic for area PFm like the well
developed layer IV and its light layer V in contrast to PF.
Likewise, we corroborated von Economo's and Koskinas's
cytoarchitectonic description of area PFcm: large pyramids in
lower layer III and a clear columnar arrangement of the cells. The
topography of PFcm in their study and ours differs, however. The
map of von Economo and Koskinas (Figs. 1C and D) shows
PFcm caudal to the Sylvian fissure, where the supramarginal
gyrus transitions to the superior temporal gyrus. We found PFcm
in the caudal part of the operculum Rolandi, i.e., in the depths of
the Sylvian fissure.
In the caudal IPC, von Economo and Koskinas defined only
one region, area PG. Its main characteristics are a small cortical
width and relatively narrow layers II and III, medium-sized
pyramids in lower layer III, a wide and well developed layer IV,
and a light layer V. This description fits with our area PGa. In
addition, however, we defined an area caudal to PGa, which we
termed area PGp.
Taken together, von Economo and Koskinas defined two main
areas in the IPC: PF rostrally and PG caudally. They considered the
other regions (PFt, PFop, PFcm, and PFm) – as the nomenclature
suggests – to be regional variants of area PF (area PG was not
subdivided any further) and did not provide any clear-cut borders
between them. We describe distinct areas (each with its own
characteristic features) with clear-cut borders between them (which
were confirmed with an observer-independent method). The IPC
areas have main characteristic features in common by which they
can be distinguished from surrounding areas. It can be stated as
well that some IPC areas have more cytoarchitectonic features in
common than others (which need not necessarily be anatomically
adjacent areas).

Vogt and Vogt (1919) studied the myeloarchitecture of
IPC. They found three areas on the free surface of the IPC (88,
89, and 90) and two areas in the caudal part of the operculum (73
and 74) (cf. Fig. 1B). The position of area 88, which also extends
into the rostral part of the operculum Rolandi, may correlate with
our areas PFt and PFop. Area 89, the main region on the free
surface of the IPC, is comparable to our PF. Like PF, area 89 also
extends into the depth of the parietal operculum. Area 90 most
likely corresponds to von Economo's and Koskinas's area PG,
which is represented by our areas PGa and PGp. A possible
correlate of our PFcm could be area 74 and that part of area 73
lying in the caudalmost parietal operculum that does not extend
onto the free surface of the IPC.

S. Caspers et al. / NeuroImage 33 (2006) 430–448 447


A similar arrangement of areas with the same nomenclature was
published by Batsch (1956), who performed myeloarchitectonic
observations in IPC. Minor differences to the map of Vogt and Vogt
(1919) can be found.

Gerhardt (1940) published a cytoarchitectonic map very similar
to the myeloarchitectonic maps of Vogt and Vogt (1919) and
Batsch (1956). In contrast to Vogt and Vogt, her area 88 has a
somewhat larger extension on the free surface of the IPC and does
not extend into the operculum, and her area 74 lies mainly in the
operculum Rolandi but also extends onto the free surface of the
IPC. Area 88 is followed caudally by areas 89 and 90, which have
a comparable extension on the IPC surface. Thus, our parcellation
is similar to the maps of both Vogt and Vogt (1919) and Gerhardt
(1940).
In a cytoarchitectonic study, Sarkissov et al. (1955) followed

Brodmann’s (1909) scheme of the IPC regarding the principal
subdivision into two areas (40 rostrally and 39 caudally), but
described also several subdivisions within each area (cf. Fig. 1E).
Some of them, like 40op and 40p/40i, may be comparable with our
areas PFop and PFm, respectively. In the caudal IPC, a straightforward correlation between their areas 39, 39s, and 39p and our areas
PGa and PGp cannot be reliably established. The cytoarchitecture of
the subdivisions 39s and 39p of Sarkissov et al. (1955) is similar to
their area 39, but exhibits also some similarities to the adjacent areas
(Sarkissov et al., 1949). 39p could at least be a part of our PGp since
Sarkissov et al. (1949) described it to be the most posterior part of
caudal IPC. However, we could not corroborate their description of
this area. The other area, 39s, was not found in our study. These
differences between our map and the map of Sarkissov et al. (1955)
may be caused by the fact that they defined architectonic borders in
only two brains by pure visual inspection, whereas a quantitative,
statistically testable and observer-independent approach was used in
the present observations.

Topographical intersubject and left–right variability

We found considerable variability between different individuals
as well as between left and right hemisphere of the same subject.
The variability involved both the topographic location of borders
and the asymmetry in size of a cortical area.
Important sulci surrounding the IPC are the intraparietal sulcus
(IPS), the Sylvian fissure, and the postcentral sulcus. In our
sample, especially the IPS and the Sylvian fissure showed an
especially high variability. The rostro-caudal extent and the
progression of the horizontal and ascending branches of the
Sylvian fissure varied between different brains and between left
and right hemispheres. The IPS differed between the brains in its
rostral starting point and its rostro-caudal continuity. In some of
our brains, the IPS consisted of two or three parts that were
separated from each other by a gyrus. These findings fit well with
former reports, e.g., of Ono et al. (1990).
This variability of sulcal patterns may explain some of the
topographical variability of the IPC areas. In hemispheres with a
short Sylvian fissure, area PF can encroach on the superior
temporal gyrus, as seen in Figs. 13B and C. The presence or
absence of small sulci within the IPC, for example, the Jenssen
sulcus, adds to the observed variability. Gyral patterns also differ
remarkably between hemispheres and brains. The macroanatomical
gyral landmarks of the IPC are the supramarginal gyrus (BA 40)
and the angular gyrus (BA 39). Differences in their size and shape
are associated with variability of size and shape in the IPC areas.


These findings explain partly the considerable variability of the
IPC areas. There are two classes of variability: class 1 variability is
not predictable from macroscopical landmarks; in contrast to that,
class 2 variability is predictable from visible landmarks. As
described by Rademacher et al. (1993), class 2 variability is found
in primary cortical areas. In the present study, class 1 variability
seems to be relevant since the cytoarchitectonic borders between the
IPC areas and adjacent areas cannot be located by macroanatomical
landmarks. The same cytoarchitectonic border, e.g., the border
between areas PF and PFm, can be found on top of a gyrus, near the
transition from gyrus to sulcus or in the depth of the sulcus.
