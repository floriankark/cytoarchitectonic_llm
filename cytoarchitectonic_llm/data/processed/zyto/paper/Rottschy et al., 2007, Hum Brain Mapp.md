Abstract: The extrastriate visual cortex forms a complex system enabling the analysis of visually presented objects. To gain deeper insight into the anatomical basis of this system, we cytoarchitectonically
mapped the ventral occipital cortex lateral to BA 18/V2 in 10 human postmortem brains. The anatomical characterization of this part of the ventral stream was performed by examination of cell-bodystained histological sections using quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis. First, the gray level index
(GLI) was measured in the ventral occipital lobe. Cytoarchitectonic borders, i.e., significant changes in
the cortical lamination pattern, were then identified using an observer-independent algorithm based on
multivariate analysis of GLI profiles. Two distinct cytoarchitectonic areas (hOC3v, hOC4v) were characterized in the ventral extrastriate cortex lateral to BA 18/V2. Area hOC3v was found in the collateral
sulcus. hOC4v was located in this sulcus and also covered the fusiform gyrus in more occipital sections. Topographically, these areas thus seem to represent the anatomical substrates of functionally
defined areas, VP/V3v and V4/V4v. Following histological analysis, the delineated cytoarchitectonic
areas were transferred to 3D reconstructions of the respective postmortem brains, which in turn were
spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute reference space. A probabilistic map was
generated for each area which describes how many brains had a representation of this area in a particular voxel. These maps can now be used to identify the anatomical correlates of functional activations
observed in neuroimaging experiments to enable a more informed investigation into the many open
questions regarding the organization of the human visual cortex. Hum Brain Mapp 28:1045–1059, 2007.

### INTRODUCTION

The primate visual cortex can be differentiated into the
striate cortex (the primary visual area, V1) receiving the
mainstream of subcortical input (Alonso, 2002; Angelucci
et al., 2002; Lund, 1988; Sherman, 2001; Worgotter
and Eysel, 2000) and the surrounding extrastriate visual
cortex which facilitates the further processing of visual

information. V1 is thought to mainly contain a direct representation of the retinal activation pattern, albeit low level
feature processing (center-surround contrast, directivity
columns) can already be found in this primary sensory
area (Foster et al., 1985; Li et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2006;
Victor et al., 1994). The adjoining extrastriate visual cortex,
on the other hand, facilitates the more advanced analyses
of visual information. It can be subdivided into two major
processing axes: the dorsal and the ventral visual stream
(Mishkin and Ungerleider, 1982; cf. review by Ettlinger,
1990). The ventral stream is mainly involved in the identification and recognition of visually presented objects
(including e.g., faces and words) based on features like
color, texture and contours (Grill-Spector et al., 1998;
Kanwisher et al., 1997; Malach et al., 2002). In contradistinction, the dorsal stream is particularly involved in
spatial processing of visual information, e.g., in the context
of eye–hand coordination (Fink et al., 2003; Grefkes et al.,
2002; Roland et al., 1998; Weiss et al., 2000).
Orban et al. (2004) proposed a distinction of three hierarchical levels of integrational complexity in the primate
visual cortex, which also correspond to different amounts
of certainty regarding the homology between different
primate species including humans. For early visual areas
(V1, V2, V3), anatomical and functional homology between
humans and nonhuman primates can be considered as
largely proven (Conway and Tsao, 2006; Foster et al., 1985;
Gallant et al., 1998; Haynes et al., 2005, but see Rosa and
Manger, 2005). For midlevel visual areas (V3A, V4, MT)
there is strong evidence for a largely preserved regional
homology of their structural and functional organization
(Hasnain et al., 1998; Larsson et al., 2006; Merriam and
Colby, 2005). There is, however, some evidence suggesting
that size, location or functional properties of at least some
of these areas were modulated in the evolutionary course
from monkeys to humans (DeYoe et al., 1996; Fize et al.,
2003; Huk et al., 2002; Tsao et al., 2003). The homology of
higher visual areas, e.g., those in the intraparietal sulcus
and on the inferior temporal lobe still has to be examined
in more detail, before conclusive inference on their homology within the primate family becomes feasible. Recent
results do nevertheless favor a preserved regional homology between the humans and nonhuman primates also for
higher order visual/polymodal areas of the posterior parietal cortex (Bremmer et al., 2001; Grefkes et al., 2002). It
has to be noted though that the suggested distinction of
visual areas into different classes of homologies within the
primate family might very likely have to be revised again
in the future based on functional and histological examination of further species (Rosa and Manger, 2005) and in particular based on further knowledge gained from performing more comparable imaging studies in humans and nonhuman primates, e.g., by means of monkey functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) (Fize et al., 2003; Vanduffel et al., 2001).
In contrast to the detailed functional topography of the
visual system which has been established for humans and

Schematic view of Brodmanns areas (Brodmann, 1909). The
cortex of the occipital lobe is only parcellated into three areas
(Area 17, 18, 19). It becomes evident that BA 19 subsumes
virtually all visual areas apart from V1 (BA 17) and V2 (BA 18).

nonhuman primates, most of the classical architectonic
maps of the human brain only show a simple tripartition
of the occipital lobe. Brodmann (Brodmann, 1909) and the
succeeding Russian school (Sarkisov et al., 1949) for example described an area termed Brodmann area (BA) 17,
representing the architectonic correlate of V1. This area is
surrounded by BA 18, which in turn most likely corresponds to the functionally defined area V2 (Amunts et al.,
2000). BA 18 is then followed by a single large area (BA
19), which covers both the ventral and dorsal aspect of the
occipital cortex from the occipital–temporal gyrus to the
parieto-occipital sulcus. That is, all visual areas apart from
V1 and V2 seem to be included in the architectonic definition of BA 19. Von Economo and Koskinas also described a tripartition of the visual cortex (von Economo and
Koskinas, 1925) consisting of area OC, which corresponds
to BA 17/V1, area OB (the most likely correlate to BA 18/
V2) and area OA, matching to Brodmanns area 19 in size
and location. In contrast to Brodmann, however, they
introduced ‘‘subregions’’ within this large occipital area,
which were interpreted as local variations of a general
architectonic pattern (Fig. 1).
It becomes evident, that these simplified maps will not
serve as useful tools for the investigation of structure–
function relationships in the human visual cortex. In addition to their overly coarse parcellation, all of these classical
brain maps also share some important conceptual shortcomings impairing their combination with functional imaging data. For example, all classical anatomical brain maps
only represent schematic two-dimensional drawings
without any information about stereotaxic location and
intersubject variability. Furthermore they are based on subjective criteria for the definitions of the borders of cortical

areas and only rarely provide information about cortical
areas within the sulci (Zilles et al., 1988). A more detailed
anatomical information is needed, which can then be integrated with data from functional imaging experiments,
neurophysiological malfunction, and primate studies to elucidate the different organizational modules in the human
(visual) cortex (cf. Eickhoff et al., 2005a; Passingham et al.,
2002; Van Essen et al., 2000).
Probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps (Amunts and Zilles,
2001; Eickhoff et al., 2005a; Zilles et al., 2002), on the other
hand, provide a tool for more valid inferences about structure–function relationships in the human brain, since these
maps are based on the observer-independent cytoarchitectonic analysis of 10 postmortem brains (Schleicher et al.,
2005). They contain stereotaxic information about the location and variability of cortical areas in the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space (Evans et al.,
1992). The use of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps thus
allows the examination of the microstructurally defined
structural substrates of a cortical activation as measured
by functional imaging experiments using fMRI, positron
emission tomography (PET), or magnet-encephalography/
electroencephalography (MEG/EEG) (Barnikol et al., 2006;
Heim et al., 2005; Hurlemann et al., 2005; Larsson et al.,
2002; Naito et al., 2005; Wilms et al., 2005; Young et al.,
2004).
Our aim was therefore to reanalyze the cytoarchitecture
of the early human ventral extrastriate cortex and to create
three-dimensional probabilistic maps (Amunts et al., 2004;
Eickhoff et al., 2005a; Mohlberg et al., 2003; Zilles et al.,
2002, 2003) for the defined areas in standard stereotaxic
space. These probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps can then
be used to compare activations of the ventral extrastriate
cortex in imaging studies, with their anatomical correlates,
and may enable the answering of some of the unresolved
questions about the functional neuroanatomy of the human
ventral extrastriate cortex.

### MATERIALS AND METHODS

 Histological Processing

Ten human postmortem brains (Amunts et al., 2000;
Malikovic et al., in press) were obtained from body donor
programs of the University of Du¨sseldorf (Table I). Only
one brain came from a subject with transitory motor disturbances. All other subjects had no history of psychiatric
or neurological diseases. Handedness of the subjects was
unknown but since on average 10% of the population is
left handed (Annett, 1973) we may assume that the majority was right handed. The brains were removed from
the skull (postmortem delay <24 h) and fixed in 4% formalin or Bodian’s fixative for at least 6 months (Fig. 2A). To
minimize distortions, the brains were suspended by
the vertebral arteries to float freely in the fixative. After
fixation, whole brain MR imaging was performed on a
Siemens 1.5T scanner (Erlangen, Germany) with a T1

weighted 3D FLASH sequence (flip angle 408, repetition
time TR ¼ 40 ms, echo time TE ¼ 5 ms for each image) for
documentation of brain size and shape. Subsequently, the
brains were embedded into paraffin, and serial whole
brain sections (coronal plane) were obtained at 20 mm. An
image of the paraffin blockface was taken after every 60th
section. Following cell body staining using a silver staining
method (Merker, 1983) the sections corresponding to the
obtained blockface images were examined, resulting in a
gap of 1.2 mm between the analyzed sections.

### Cytoarchitectonic Mapping

Regions of interest (ROIs) were defined on the ventral
occipital cortex (Fig. 2B) and were digitized by a computercontrolled microscope, scanning the ROI in a meander-like
sequence using a CCD camera. The digitized sections were
converted to gray level index (GLI) images (Schleicher
et al., 2000; Wree et al., 1982), which quantify the volume
fractions of cell bodies in the corresponding measuring
fields (Fig. 2C), to ameliorate differences in the staining intensity within and between sections (for further image acquisition and preprocessing details see (Amunts et al., 2000;
Eickhoff et al., 2006c; Grefkes et al., 2001; Schleicher et al.,
1999)).
The cortical ribbon was defined in the GLI-images by
interactively tracing an outer contour between layers I and
II, and an inner line between layer VI and the white matter.
Curvilinear traverses, running perpendicular to the cortical
layers from the outer to the inner contour (Fig. 2D), were
automatically calculated based on the Laplace equation
(Annese et al., 2004; Jones et al., 2000; Schleicher et al., 2005;
Schmitt and Bohme, 2002). Along these traverses, profiles
describing the changes in the laminar cell density pattern
(Schleicher et al., 2000, 2005) were extracted from the GLI
images. The shape of these profiles was quantitatively
described using a 10 element feature vector, made up from
the following parameters: mean GLI, cortical depth of the
center of gravity, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis of the profile, as well as the analogous parameters for
the absolute value of its first derivative (Amunts et al.,
2000; Dixon et al., 1988; Zilles et al., 2002). Areal borders

were subsequently identified at those profile positions
where the layer pattern of the cortex changes significantly
(Fig. 2E,F). To reveal such transitions, blocks of profiles
were compared with the neighboring blocks using a sliding window algorithm (Schleicher et al., 2000, 2005). The
dissimilarity between these blocks was quantified using
the Mahalonobis distance (Mahalanobis et al., 1949) and
were statistically tested using a Hotelling’s T[2]-test (Bonferroni correction for multiple comparisons). This procedure
was repeated for several block sizes to identify those borders that were consistent in spite of the inevitable noise in
the images. The results of this observer-independent
approach were then confirmed by a visual comparison
with the histological sections and validated in a stack of
neighboring sections (cf. Eickhoff et al., 2006c; Grefkes
et al., 2001; Malikovic et al., in press; Morosan et al., 2001;
Zilles et al., 2002).

### Computation of Probabilistic Cytoarchitectonic Maps

The histological volumes of the brains were 3D reconstructed (Amunts et al., 2004; Mohlberg et al., 2003) using


the following three data sets available for each of the 10
postmortem brains: (i) The MRT scan, a 3D volume with
only minor deformations but low spatial resolution. (ii)
The blockface images, containing a reference grid to establish the integrity of the data set orthogonal to the cutting
plane. (iii) Digitized images of the cell body stained
sections. These images show the most detailed anatomical
information but are highly deformed and contain no
spatial reference. The defined areas were then interactively
transferred to the respective sections of the reconstructed
volume.
The reconstructed postmortem brains were then spatially
normalized to the T1-weighted single-subject template of
the MNI (Evans et al., 1992) using a nonlinear elastic registration algorithm (Amunts et al., 2004; Henn et al., 1997;
Ho¨mke, 2006; Mohlberg et al., 2003). The origin of the
MNI reference space, however, does not coincide with the
location of the anterior commissure (AC) of this specific
template brain but is located 4 mm more caudally (y-axis)
and 5 mm more dorsally (z-axis). To keep the AC as
the anatomical reference of the coordinate system, the
origin of the cytoarchitectonic maps was corrected for
this displacement. The maps are thus registered in the

Overview of the cytoarchitecture of hOC3v and hOC4v. Area hOC3v is characterized by a fine
columnar arrangement of its cells, an inconspicuous layer IV and the absence of prominent
pyramidal cells in deeper layer III. Area hOC4v on the other hand shows a high amount of larger
pyramidal cells in deeper layer III, more prominent layers IV and VI as well as a border columnar
arrangement. Roman numbers denote cortical layers, bar: 1 mm.


‘anatomical MNI space’ (Amunts et al., 2005; Eickhoff
et al., 2005a), which differs from the original MNI space
only by the linear shift of the origin. Following spatial
normalization, the corresponding areas of the different
subjects were superimposed and a probabilistic map was
generated for each area (Eickhoff et al., 2006b). It describes,
for each voxel of the reference brain, how many individual
brains overlapped with the respective cytoarchitectonic
area in that particular voxel.

### Quantitative Analysis of Volumes and Stereotaxic Location

The volumes of areas hOC3v and hOC4v were then
analyzed with respect to interhemispheric and interareal
differences by a two-way analysis of variance (ANOVA)
using the following design: the two factors were ‘hemisphere’ (left, right) and ‘area’ (hOC3v, hOC4v); the
blocking factor was ‘brain’. The level of significance
was P < 0.05. If the effect of a factor was significant,
we used a subsequent pairwise multiple comparison
procedure (Tukey test) to isolate the conditions in
which the levels of this factor differed significantly (P <
0.05).
Interhemispheric differences in the stereotaxic location
of hOC3v and hOC4v with respect to the anterior–
posterior, the medial–lateral, and the inferior–superior
axes were tested by using the same procedure.


### Cytoarchitectonic Probability Maps and Maximum Probability Map

As described in the section ‘‘Computation of Probabilistic Cytoarchitectonic Maps’’, probabilistic maps were
generated for hOC3v and hOC4v as well as for V1, V2
(Amunts et al., 2000), and hOC5 (Malikovic et al., in press).
A maximum probability map (MPM) of all these areas, i.e.,
a summary map of all early ventral visual areas defined to
date, was computed by comparing the probabilities for
each area (i.e., the numbers of overlapping representations)
in each voxel (Eickhoff et al., 2005a) and assigning each
voxel to the most likely anatomical area. If different areas
showed equally high probabilities for occurring in the
same voxel, this voxel was assigned to that area which
showed the higher average probability in the 26 directly
adjacent voxels. To evaluate the quality of representation,
volumes and locations of the MPM representations were
subsequently compared with the mean values for the
respective area after normalization.

### RESULTS

Two distinct cytoarchitectonic areas were identified in
the ventral extrastriate human visual cortex lateral to BA
18 (see Fig. 3). Adopting a neutral nomenclature to avoid a
premature implication of correspondence with functionally
defined regions, these areas were named hOC3v and
hOC4v (h, human; OC, occipital cortex; v, ventral).

hOC3v is located immediately lateral to the ventral part
of BA 18/V2. It was found in the collateral sulcus in all
the 20 examined hemispheres. More laterally, a second
area was identified which directly bordered hOC3v over
its full length. This area (hOC4v) was located in the collateral sulcus in the more frontal sections, but also covered
large parts of the fusiform gyrus in the more occipital
sections in all the 20 hemispheres. Both hOC3v and hOC4v
were mainly located on the ventral aspect of the occipital
lobe, but also occupied parts of its lateral surface close to
the occipital pole.
The cytoarchitecture of area hOC3v differs from that of
BA 18/V2 (Amunts et al., 2000) in many aspects; area
hOC3v is characterized by distinct cell columns which are
less present in BA 18. Although layer II of area hOC3v is
only moderately cell dense without a clear border to layer
III, these layers are clearly distinguished in BA 18
(Fig. 4A). Area hOC3v has a rather cell sparse layer III
without a marked increase in the size of pyramidal cells
from sublayer IIIa to sublayer IIIc. In contrast, BA 18 has a
more cell dense layer III and features distinctly large
pyramidal cells in layer IIIc. Although layer IV of hOC3v
only shows a moderate cell density (rendering its transition to layer V rather inconspicuous), layer IV of BA 18
shows a clearly higher cell density and has a well defined
border to a cell sparse layer V. Finally, both the layers V
and VI are more cell sparse in BA 18, when compared
with hOC3v.
In the most occipital sections, hOC3v also borders an
area which follows the dorsal part of BA 18. Following the
neutral nomenclature used throughout this correspondence, this area which putatively represents the structural
substrate of functionally defined area V3 (or V3d) (Zeki,
1969a) will be labeled hOC3d. The external granular cell
layer (layer II) is distinctly less cell dense in area hOC3d
than in hOC3v. Although an increase of the size of pyramidal cells within layer III is seen in both areas (hOC3d and
hOC3v), the number of large pyramidal cells is smaller in
hOC3d than in hOC3v (Fig. 4B). In area hOC3d, layer IV is
more cell sparse and has a better defined border to layer
V. Furthermore, layers V and VI are similarly cell dense in
area hOC3d, resulting in an inconspicuous border between
these layers. In hOC3v, on the other hand, layer V contains
markedly fewer and smaller cells than layer VI, resulting
in a better separation of these two layers.
Area hOC4v is found lateral to hOC3v on the lateral
bank of the collateral sulcus and on the fusiform gyrus.
Compared with area hOC3v, hOC4v is characterized by a
more cell dense layer II and a much more pronounced
increase of density and size of pyramidal cells throughout
layer III. In contrast to hOC3v, layer IV is very prominent
in area hOC4v (Fig. 5A). The higher cell packing density
in the inner granular layer (layer IV) provided one of the
main features for the differentiation between hOC3v and
hOC4v. The absolute cell density within both the layers V
and VI is higher in hOC4v than in hOC3v, although layer
V of hOC4v shows only few large pyramidal cells.


**Figure 4.**
**A: Border between area hOC3v and area hOC3d. This border**
is marked by a decrease in the size of pyramidal cells in layer III
in hOC3v. Furthermore hOC3v is characterized by a less cell
dense layer IV and the presence of distinct cell columns not
present to the same degree in area V2. Roman numbers denote
cortical layers; bar, 1 mm. B: Border between area hOC3v and
area hOC3d/V3d. It is characterized by a further decline in the
size of pyramidal cells in layer III in hOC3d compared with
hOC3v and by a more pronounced columnar arrangement in
hOC3d.

The cortex lateral to hOC4v (putatively corresponding to
functionally defined V4d (Tootell and Hadjikhani, 2001),
the lateral occipital cortex (LOC) (Malach et al., 1995), and
the fusifom face area (FFA) (Kanwisher et al., 1997)) features more pronounced cell columns than area hOC4v.
The transition between layers II and III is less well defined,

in hOC4v. Layer IV shows the most pronounced differences, as it is considerably thicker and more cell dense in
hOC4v when compared with the cortex lateral to it. Layer
V of the cortex following lateral to hOC4v is rather cell
sparse and has a clear border to layer VI. Since both the
layers V and VI feature similarly high cell packing densities in hOC4v, the border between these layers is less
well defined in this latter area. Finally, the cortex–white
matter border is less well defined in the cortex lateral to
hOC4v than in hOC4v.

### Volumes and Stereotaxic Localization of Areas hOC3v and hOC4v

There was a high intersubject variability in size and
location of both areas (Table II). The volumes of hOC3v,
for example, ranged from 4447 mm[3] to 13,707 mm[3] among
brains. In the statistical analysis, no volume differences
were found between the two hemispheres for either area
(no significant interaction between the factors area and
side: F ¼ 0.34, P > 0.05). Similarly, there was no statistically significant difference in the mean volumes between
hOC3v and hOC4v after allowing for effects of interindividual variations (effect of factor area: F ¼ 2.12, P > 0.05).
The coordinates for the centers of gravity of hOC3v and
hOC4v in anatomical MNI space are given in Table III.
Significant interhemispheric differences in the medial–
lateral and anterior–posterior location were observed for
both hOC3v and hOC4v. In detail, both areas were located more laterally and anterior in the right hemisphere
(FML ¼ 11.75, FAP ¼ 7.45, P < 0.05), a fact which might
be explained by the marked asymmetry of the occipital
pole of the MNI single subject template. There was,
however, no difference in location of either area along
the ventral–dorsal axis (P > 0.05).

### Probability Maps of the Ventral Extrastriate Cortex

Probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps in the anatomical
MNI reference space were computed for hOC3v and
hOC4v (Figs. 6 and 8). These maps showed that high probabilities, corresponding to locations where a specific area
was found in, e.g., 9 out of 10 examined brains, were only
observed for a small number of voxels. In contrast, the
volumes for low probabilities, e.g., made up by a voxel
containing an area in 2 out of 10 brains, were considerably
larger. As a consequence, the probabilistic maps of hOC3v,
hOC4v, BA 17, and BA 18 overlapped considerably at
lower probabilities, i.e., it was impossible to assign all
voxels in the ventral occipital cortex unequivocally to a
specific cytoarchitectonic area at lower thresholds.
In contradistinction, the MPM of the early visual areas
(Figs. 7 and 8) (Amunts et al., 2000) represents a contiguous, nonoverlapping parcellation of the occipital cortex.
Importantly the MPM does not show the parcellation of an
exemplary or ‘typical’ hemisphere as do classical architectonic brain maps (e.g., Brodmann, 1909), but reflects the
most likely area at each position in a sample of 10 postmortem brains.
In total, 23,622 voxels (1 mm[3] each) were assigned to
either hOC3v or hOC4v in the computed MPM of the early
visual cortex. This corresponds to a volume representation
of approximately 85% relative to the mean areal volumes
after nonlinear normalization, i.e., the MPM representations of hOC3v and hOC4v were approximately 15%
smaller than the average size of the respective areas after
normalization. This deviation from the mean volume is
thus in the same range as observed for MPM representations of other cortical areas (Eickhoff et al., 2006b). There is
also a good match in stereotaxic location between hOC3v
and hOC4v and their representations in the MPM (Table II). All but two (z-location of area hOC4v) coordinates


for the centers of gravity of the MPM representations are
located within only one standard deviation of the mean
coordinates of the respective area.

### DISCUSSION

This study reports two distinct architectonic areas in the
ventral extrastriate human visual cortex lateral to BA 18
(hOC3v and hOC4v), which were identified using classical
histological criteria and quantitative cytoarchitectonic
analysis (Schleicher et al., 1998, 2005). The application of a
statistical approach for the detection of areal borders
represent an important difference from the classical cytoarchitectonic examinations (e.g., Brodmann, 1909; Sarkisov et al.,
1949; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925), which relied purely
on the visual inspection of histological sections and were
thus largely subjective. Area hOC3v is located in the collateral sulcus; hOC4v is found on the lateral bank of this sulcus but also reaches the fusiform gyrus in the occipital sections. To interpret the cytoarchitectonic entities, they have
to be related to previous architectonic maps of the human
occipital cortex, results of nonhuman primate research,
and human functional imaging studies.

### Comparison With Previous Architectonic Maps

Classical anatomical brain maps mainly show a tripartition of the ventral extrastriate cortex (Brodmann, 1909;
Sarkisov et al., 1949). Only von Economo and Koskinas,
whose area OA corresponds to the extrastriate visual cortex anterior to BA 18/V2, mapped regional variations in
the cytoarchitectonic features of these areas (von Economo
and Koskinas, 1925). That is, they described architectonic
differences between the dorsal, lateral, and ventral parts of
area OA, which may correspond to the differentiation between the dorsal and ventral streams, as well as the higher
order visual areas on the lateral occipital lobe. In particular, the differentiation between subareas OAm (ventral)
and OA2 (dorsal) and OA (lateral) may very well correspond to the described differences between the ventral
extrastriate areas hOC3v/hOC4v, hOC3d and the LOC,
respectively, although the locations of the borders between
these subregions were not indicated by von Economo and
Koskinas. Differences within the ventral extrastriate cortex,
however, corresponding to the differentiation between
hOC3v and hOC4v, were not described.
Brodmann’s area 19 has later been reinvestigated using
myeloarchitectonic (Clarke and Miklossy, 1990) and cytoarchitectonic criteria (Clarke et al., 2000; Zilles and Clarke,
1997). In these studies, the area following BA 18 in the
ventral stream of the extrastriate cortex (termed area VP)
is described as follows: ‘‘VP is lightly myelinated and lacks
the large pyramids in layer III. The cortex lateral to VP is
heavily myelinated and contains fairly large pyramids
in layers III and V.’’ This description is thus similar to our
cytoarchitectonic characterization of area hOC3v and
hOC4v. Moreover, the size and location of area VP and its

hOC3v and hOC4v as well. Supplementing the data of
Clarke et al., we here report probabilistic maps of hOC3v
and hOC4v which represent a major advance, since this
information can now directly be correlated with functional
imaging results in order to characterize structure–function
relationships (Eickhoff et al., 2005a).

### Comparison With Data from Nonhuman Primates

Electrophysiological, tracing, and histological studies of
nonhuman primates (Cavada and Goldman-Rakic, 1993;
Felleman et al., 1997) as well as fMRI studies in these
species (Orban et al., 2004) revealed a much more complex
organization of the extrastriate cortex as described in classical human maps. The ventral part of BA 18 is followed by
a smaller area in the collateral sulcus, either termed VP
(Van Essen et al., 2001) or ventral V3 (V3v) (Desimone and
Ungerleider, 1986; Zeki, 1969b). The dorsal part of V2, on
the other hand, is followed by area V3 (or its dorsal part
V3d in the alternate nomenclature defining the ventral
neighbor of V2 as area V3v) (Boussaoud et al., 1991;
Felleman and Van Essen, 1991). In this context, it is important to point out that areas VP or V3v are almost identical
in size and location. Thus, rather than denoting two distinct areas, these terms express different views about the
functional relationship between this ventral extrastriate
area to its dorsal counterpart. Although some authors have


shown functional differences between VP and dorsal V3 in
macaques, e.g., in the response to color stimuli (Burkhalter
et al., 1986; Felleman and Van Essen, 1987) and thus
coined the term VP, this view was contradicted by others,
who did not find such functional differences and argue
that V3v and V3d jointly contain a single representation of
the visual world and are thus parts of a single area (e.g.,
Gardner et al., 2005; Wade et al., 2004; Zeki, 1978a).
Comparison of the size and location of primate areas
VP/V3v to area hOC3v as defined by cytoarchitectonic
mapping in human postmortem brains reveals that hOC3v
is topologically equivalent to VP/V3v. This supports the
notion of close homology between monkeys and humans
for early visual areas (Conway and Tsao, 2006; Foster
et al., 1985; Haynes et al., 2005). However, the fact that we
described architectonic differences between hOC3v and the
area which follows BA 18/V2 dorsally may be seen as
evidence for a differentiation between the dorsal and ventral visual cortex anterior to BA 18/V2 at least in humans.
The area, which laterally borders VP/V3v over its entire
extent, was originally termed ‘‘V4’’ by Zeki (1969b) and is
well studied for filtering properties (Desimone and Schein,
1987), color (Van Essen and Zeki, 1978; Zeki, 1978b), models of visual processing (Girard et al., 2002), and extraretinal modulation (Moran and Desimone, 1985) in macaque
monkeys. In comparison to area V4 (Zeki, 1978a) in nonhuman primates, human area hOC4v is found at an almost
identical position, but appears to be considerably smaller
in size with respect to the whole extend of the visual

cortex. Although area V4 in monkeys covers the entire
fusiform gyrus and extends up to the inferior temporal
lobe, human area hOC4v covers the lateral bank of the sulcus collateralis and reaches only the fusiform gyrus in the
occipital sections.
Based on electrophysiological and connection evidence
from macaque monkeys (Felleman and Van Essen, 1991) as
well as recent fMRI studies (Orban et al., 2004; Sereno
et al., 1995), it has been suggested that V4 may be divided
into a ventral part (V4v), located next to VP/V3v, and a
dorsal part (V4d) located on the LOC. Because V4v covers
only the collateral sulcus and the medial aspect of the fusiform gyrus, it appears to be more consistent with the
extent of human area hOC4v than area V4, although the
large interspecies differences in the relative sizes of visual
cortical areas (Van Essen et al., 2001) render such comparisons very difficult and point to the need of further research
in this direction.

### Comparison With Human Functional Imaging Data

One of the most commonly used techniques for the
functional delineation of visual areas is the application of
retinotopic mapping (DeYoe et al., 1996; Engel et al., 1997;
Grill-Spector et al., 1998; Sereno et al., 1995; Warnking
et al., 2002). Hereby a cortical area can be defined on the
basis of changes in the visual field sign and characterized
as containing either the representation of a single quadrant
of the contralateral visual scene or a complete hemifield.
For the ventral extrastriate cortex, however, this method
has provided slightly conflicting results; some authors
stated that VP/V3v is followed by a retinotopic quadrant
representation in an area corresponding to area V4v
in other primates. This (upper) quadrant representation in
V4v is matched by a representation of the contralateral
lower visual quarterfield within neighboring area V4d.
Anterior to V4v, a further complete hemifield representation was postulated (Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001). In
contrast, Zeki et al. (1998) described VP/V3v as the last
retinotopic quadrant representation in the ventral visual
stream. This quadrant representation is then followed by a
complete hemifield representation in area V4 (Zeki et al.,
1998).
In this context, it is important to note that our data
shows that hOC3v (i.e., VP/V3v) and hOC3d (V3d) constitute two distinct cytoarchitectonic areas. On the other hand,
retinotopic mapping clearly demonstrated that area VP/
V3v only contains a representation of the contralateral
upper quarterfield, whereas V3d contains the matching
lower quarterfield representation (Engel et al., 1997;
Grill-Spector et al., 1998; Warnking et al., 2002). These
studies therefore suggest that VP/V3v and V3d are both
part of a single visual area, since bilateral VP/V3v (upper
quadrants) and V3d (lower quadrants) contain a single
complete representation of the whole visual world.


This discrepancy raises some important questions: Why
are upper and lower visual fields represented in architectonically different parts of the cortex? Which functional
differences, if any, correspond to these architectonic differences? Are such architectonic and functional differences
related to the fact that different parts of the visual world
(upper vs. lower field) are represented in the dorsal
respective ventral visual cortex? A promising approach to
answer these questions and to gain further insight into
the organization of the early visual cortices may be provided by a multimodal approach which combines anatomical data such as receptor architectonic investigations
(Hurlemann et al., 2005; Zilles et al., 2004), cytoarchitectonic mapping (Amunts et al., 2000; Malikovic et al.,
in press), structural MR imaging (Walters et al., in press;
Eickhoff et al., 2005b), retinotopic mapping (Tootell et al.,
1997), and functional imaging experiments (Larsson et al.,
2002; Wilms et al., 2005) in a common analysis framework.
Such integration of anatomical and functional data
(Eickhoff et al., 2005a) will also help to further characterize
the cortex lateral to VP/V3v, i.e., the functional equivalent
to hOC4v. This region (commonly termed V4) is supposed
to be strongly responsive during segregated texture stimuli
in comparison to uniform textures (Kastner et al., 2000).
This is in good agreement to lesion studies in nonhuman
primates showing that lesions in area V4 appear to disrupt
only those texture discriminations that require grouping of
similar elements to form a pop out (Merigan, 2000). The
part of V4 that was termed V4v by some authors (Orban
et al., 2004) was also reported to show an increase of activation in particular when contour stimuli are presented
(Schira et al., 2004). However, as outlined earlier, the existence of V4v (quadrant representation) as opposed to an
area V4 (hemifield) is in itself still a matter of conjecture.
Similarly, there is an ongoing debate whether V4v is part
of the human color selective region V4 (McKeefry and
Zeki, 1997; Zeki et al., 1991) or whether the color center in
the human visual cortex is located anterior to V4v and
should then be termed V8 (Hadjikhani et al., 1998).

### CONCLUSIONS

The presented study investigated the microstructural
organization of the early ventral extrastriate visual cortex.
In contrast to classical anatomical maps (e.g., that of
Brodmann (1909)) which only show a schematized image
of the brain’s surface, our probabilistic maps are provided
in standardized three-dimensional stereotaxic space. Therefore, it is now possible to combine these cytoarchitectonic
data with statistical activation maps from fMRI (Wilms
et al., 2005) and PET (Hurlemann et al., 2005) experiments
or with equivalent dipoles from MEG or EEG studies
(Barnikol et al., 2006). This integrated analysis of structure
and function of the early ventral visual stream will then
provide new and detailed answers to the many pending

questions, e.g., the relationship between VP/V3v and V3d
or the location of the human color center.
To encourage the use of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic
maps of hOC3v and hOC4v in the context of functional
imaging experiments, these maps, together with a software
