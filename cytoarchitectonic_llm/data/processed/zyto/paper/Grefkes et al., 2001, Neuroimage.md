**We analyzed the topographical variability of human**
**somatosensory area 2 in 10 postmortem brains. The**
**brains were serially sectioned at 20 �m, and sections**
**were stained for cell bodies. Area 2 was delineated**
**with an observer-independent technique based on sig-**
**nificant differences in the laminar densities of cell**
**bodies. The sections were corrected with an MR scan**
**of the same brain obtained before histological process-**
**ing. Each brain’s histological volume and representa-**
**tion of area 2 was subsequently reconstructed in 3-D.**
**We found that the borders of area 2 are topographi-**
**cally variable. The rostral border lies between the con-**
**vexity of the postcentral gyrus and some millimeters**
**deep in the rostral wall of the postcentral sulcus. The**
**caudal border lies between the fundus of the postcen-**
**tral sulcus and some millimeters above it in the rostral**
**wall. In contrast to Brodmann’s map, area 2 does not**
**extend onto the mesial cortical surface or into the**
**intraparietal sulcus. When the postcentral sulcus is**
**interrupted by a gyral bridge, area 2 crosses this**
**bridge and is not separated into two segments. After**
**cytoarchitectonic analysis, the histological volumes**
**were warped to the reference brain of a computerized**
**atlas and superimposed. A population map was gener-**
**ated in 3-D space, which describes how many brains**
**have a representation of area 2 in a particular voxel.**

**INTRODUCTION**

Both in monkeys and in humans the classical primary somatosensory cortex consists of four different
areas (Brodmann, 1909; Vogt and Vogt, 1919; von


Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Powell and Mountcastle,
1959a), which differ in cytoarchitecture and process
different submodalities of the somatosensory system.
Area 3a in the depth of the central sulcus receives its
input mainly from muscle spindles. Area 3b in the
rostral wall of the postcentral gyrus receives afferents
from both rapidly and slowly adapting cutaneous receptors, area 1 on the vertex of the postcentral gyrus
predominantly from rapidly adapting cutaneous receptors. Caudal to area 1 lies area 2 which receives input
mainly from deep receptors in joints (Kaas, 1993,
1997). The electrophysiological properties of these areas have been extensively characterized in monkeys. In
contrast to areas 3b and 1, neurons in area 2 respond to
more complex cutaneous stimuli (e.g., direction or orientation of a stimulus) or to active tactile discrimination tasks (Hyva¨rinen and Poranen, 1978; Gardner and
Costanzo, 1980; Costanzo and Gardner, 1980;
Iwamura et al., 1983a, 1983b; Warren et al., 1986; Ruiz
_et al., 1995). Much of this knowledge has been gained_
from studies in nonhuman primates in which direct
comparisons between structure and function are fairly
easy to perform since upon completion of the electrophysiological part of the study the brains can be sectioned, sections can be stained for cell bodies, and
penetration sites can be directly correlated with the
cytoarchitectonic pattern. For obvious ethical reasons,
such an approach is not feasible in humans.
Many cytoarchitectonic maps of the human cortex
have been published in the first half of the 20th Century (Campbell, 1905; Brodmann, 1909; von Economo
and Koskinas, 1925; Bailey and von Bonin, 1951;
Sarkissov et al., 1955). These “classical” brain maps,
however, were published in a 2-dimensional print format. They are schematic drawings which reflect the
topographical situation in one representative brain
(usually only on its exposed cortical surface since the
sulci are not opened up). The problem of interindividual macro- (see, e.g., Ono et al., 1990) and microan

-----

is not taken into consideration. Furthermore, “classical” brain maps are “rigid”, i.e., they are not based on a
spatial reference system and cannot be adapted to individual brains. Hence, multimodal integration of
structural and functional data obtained from different
brains is impossible.
A second problem is the subjectivity underlying any
cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the cortex. In the past,
it had not been possible to define borders between
cortical areas in an objective and observer-independent
way. Biological variability and each investigator’s subjective criteria have influenced the results and introduced considerable variations. These two factors
(which cannot be disentangled) have led to the wellknown differences between the maps published by different authors.
To overcome many of these problems, a new approach has recently been introduced: Cortical areas are
delineated with an observer-independent cytoarchitectonic technique in postmortem brains (Schleicher et al.,
1999) and are then transferred to a computerized brain
atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994). For each area, a volume
of interest (VOI) can then be defined which is not based
on macroanatomical landmarks of the cortex but instead on cytoarchitectonic mapping of postmortem
brains. Somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1 have already been mapped with this technique (Geyer et al.,
1999, 2000). In a functional study (Bodegard et al.,
2000), regional cerebral blood flow changes were determined with PET when subjects discriminated differences in the speed of a moving stimulus. The PET data
were transferred to the computerized atlas and superimposed with the microstructural VOIs of areas 3a, 3b,
and 1. The activation cluster significantly overlapped
with areas 3b and 1 but, in addition, extended further
caudally into the cortex along the postcentral sulcus.
Could this mean that area 2 was also activated by this
task? Electrophysiological studies in monkeys have
shown that a mechanical stimulus with a fixed orientation in space is an adequate stimulus for neurons in
area 2. However, in functional imaging studies in humans, an activation of area 2 can be postulated but it
cannot be proven since borders between cortical areas
are not visible even on high-resolution MR scans and
they are topographically variable across different individuals (Rademacher et al., 1993; Roland and Zilles,
1994; Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Geyer
_et al., 1996, 1999; Roland and Zilles, 1996; White et al.,_
1997; Roland et al., 1997; Amunts et al., 1999; Amunts
_et al., 2000)._
As a further step toward a solution of this problem,
the present study was performed. We mapped somatosensory area 2 in an observer-independent way in 10
postmortem brains. The 10 volume representations
were then warped to the reference brain of the computi d tl i d i 3 D d i


Superimposition with PET or fMRI data in the same
reference space should then give a more valid answer
to the question whether or not area 2 is being activated
by a somatosensory task.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

The main steps are summarized as a flowchart in
Table 1.

_Histological and MR Processing of the Brains_

The analysis was done in 10 postmortem human
brains (5 males, 5 females) obtained at autopsy from
subjects with no known history of neurological or psychiatric diseases (age range 37–85 years, mean age
68.9 years, cf. Table 2). All subjects had given written
consent before death and/or had been included in the
body donor program of the Department of Anatomy,
University of Du¨sseldorf, Germany. The brains were
removed from the skull and fixed in 4% formaldehyde
or in Bodian’s fixative (90 ml of 80% ethanol, 5 ml of
37% formaldehyde, 5 ml of glacial acetic acid) for approximately 5 months. Fixation was done in a freely
floating way, i.e., by suspending the brains at the basilar artery to avoid compression or distortions. After
fixation, T1 weighted MR scans (1.5 T Siemens Magnetron SP scanner, 3-D fast low angle shot (3-D
FLASH) pulse sequence, flip angle � 40°, TR � 40 ms,
TE � 5 ms, voxel size � 1.17 mm (mediolateral) � 1
mm (rostrocaudal) � 1 mm (dorsoventral)) were acquired for documentation of brain size and shape before subsequent histological processing, which leads to
shrinkage and distortions of the brains. The brains
were dehydrated in graded alcohols, embedded in paraffin, and serially sectioned (20 �m whole brain sections) in a coronal (9 brains) or sagittal (1 brain) plane
with a microtome for large sections. Images of the
paraffin blockface were obtained after each 60th section (coronal plane) or 45th section (sagittal plane)
with a CCD camera (XC-75, Sony/Japan, image matrix
256 � 256 pixels, 8-bit gray value resolution). Each
60th section (coronal plane) or 45th section (sagittal
plane) was mounted on a gelatin-coated slide and was
stained for cell bodies with a Nissl-like method
(Merker, 1983), which yields high contrast between cell
bodies (black) and neuropil (light brown), a prerequisite for quantitative cytoarchitectonic analysis.

_Observer-Independent Delineation of_
_Cytoarchitectonic Borders_

Rectangular regions of interest (ROIs) covering the
postcentral gyrus and sulcus were defined in each cellstained section in both hemispheres. Each ROI was
scanned in a mosaic-like sequence with a CCD camera
(XC 75 S /J i t i 512 � 512 i l

8-bit gray value resolution) attached to a microscope
(Universal microscope, Zeiss/Germany, image size
540 � 540 �m), which was equipped with a computercontrolled motorized stage and an autofocus unit. The
image sequence was further processed with an image
analysis software package (KS 400, Version 3.0, Zeiss/
Germany) and a standard PC. In each image (size
540 � 540 �m), the areal fraction of darkly stained cell
bodies (gray level index; GLI) was measured after
adaptive thresholding (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990) in
square, adjoining fields (size 20 � 20 �m). This proce

dure was performed in each image of the sequence. The
resulting data matrix covering the entire ROI is the
GLI image (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990).
Equidistant density profiles (125 �m wide, spacing
between adjacent profiles 200 �m) covering the entire
ROI were extracted from the GLI images perpendicularly to the cortical layers. The profiles extended from
the border between layers I and II (outer contour) to
the border between layer VI and the white matter
(inner contour). Both contour lines were defined interactively in each GLI image with a graphics tablet, and
equidistant profiles were automatically extracted from
the GLI image (Schleicher et al., 2000).
The profiles were standardized to a length of 101
points by resampling the data with linear interpolation
in order to compensate for variations in cortical thickness. To quantify each profile’s shape, 10 features
based on the GLI distribution pattern across the cortical layers were calculated and combined into one feature vector. A mean feature vector was calculated from
a block of b (e.g., b � 12) adjacent profiles, and another
mean feature vector from a neighboring block of b
adjacent profiles. Differences between the mean feature vectors from two neighboring blocks of profiles
were calculated as Mahalanobis distances D2 (Mahal2
anobis et al., 1949). D values were plotted as a function of the positions of the profile blocks within the
ROI. The resulting distance function revealed maxima
t th l ti h th i d b fil

cal significance was evaluated by a Hotelling’s T2 test.
The corresponding P values were Bonferroni-corrected
for multiple comparisons. For each ROI, distance functions were calculated for blocksizes from b � 8 to b �
20, and the positions of significant maxima were plotted as a function of b (cf. Figs. 2 and 5). The positions
of these maxima were then compared with the cytoarchitectonic pattern in the cell-stained sections. For further details see (Schleicher et al., 1999, 2000; Geyer
_et al., 1999)._
In order to visualize the laminar neuronal pattern of
area 1 and 2, 10 adjacent GLI profiles of each area were
extracted from one representative section (right hemisphere of each brain). The sections were selected according to the following criteria: (i) No artifacts caused
by histological processing, (ii) orientation of the sectioning plane perpendicular to the cortical surface, (iii)
random selection of the sections fulfilling criteria (i)
and (ii). The profiles were standardized in length and
averaged, resulting in one mean profile for each area
and brain. In a second step, the 10 mean profiles (each
representing one brain) of each area were averaged
again and plotted (cf. Figs. 4A and 4B). Profiles were
not extracted from the posterior parietal cortex (PPC)
caudal to area 2 since the PPC is cytoarchitectonically
heterogeneous and the topography of its areas has not
yet been elucidated in sufficient detail.

_3-D Reconstruction of the Histological Volume_

Each mounted and cell-stained histological section
was digitized with the CCD camera (image matrix
256 � 256 pixels, 8-bit gray value resolution). The
histological volume of the brain was then reconstructed
in 3-D from the images of the paraffin blockface, the
digitized histological sections, and the MR volume of
the same brain using linear and nonlinear transformations (Schormann et al., 1993, 1995, 1996, 1997a;
Schormann and Zilles, 1997). Since the MR volume
was obtained prior to histological processing, any artifacts (e.g., shrinkage of the brain due to dehydration in
graded alcohols or compression of the sections due to
cutting) could be eliminated in the 3-D reconstructed
histological volume by matching it with the MR volume
of the same brain. The statistically significant borders
of area 2 were marked on the histological sections.
With an image analysis software package and an interactive voxel-painting tool (KS 400, Version 3.0,
Zeiss/Germany) the extent of area 2 was labeled in the
corresponding sections of the reconstructed volume.
Thus, a microstructurally defined representation of cytoarchitectonic area 2 was obtained in the 3-D reconstructed histological volume of each brain.
Area 2 is mostly hidden in the depth of the postcentral sulcus. Therefore, in order to reveal its topography
in relation to the macroanatomy of the postcentral

ing white matter with the KS 400 software package.
The extent of area 2 was then traced along the gray/
white matter interface (cf. Figs. 6A and 6B). The volume was filtered with an isotropic Gaussian kernel
(FWHM � 1 mm) and the surface of the gray/white
matter interface (with the extent of area 2) was rendered in 3-D with the AVS Express software (AVS Inc.,
Waltham, MA) (cf. Figs. 6C and 6D).

_Spatial Normalization_

Each 3-D reconstructed histological volume (with the
volume representation of area 2; prior to gray/white
matter segmentation) was spatially normalized to the
reference brain of the computerized atlas (which is
oriented in the Talairach coordinate system; see Roland et al., 1994) with a new algorithm based on an
extended principal axes theory (Schormann et al.,
1997b) and a fast automated multiresolution full-multigrid movement model (Schormann and Zilles, 1997,
1998; Schormann, 1998).
The 10 normalized histological volumes (with the
representations of area 2) were superimposed in the
3-D space of the reference brain and a population map
was generated for area 2, which describes, for each
voxel, how many brains have a representation of area 2
in this particular voxel. For further details see Geyer et
_al. (2000)._

**RESULTS**

_Observer-Independent Cytoarchitectonic Mapping of_
_Area 2_

Figure 1A shows a dorsal view of brain 340/83 after
fixation in formalin for 5 months. Sagittal whole brain
section no. 3811 (cf. dashed line in Fig. 1A) is depicted
in Fig. 1B. The box in Fig. 1B marks the ROI encompassing the postcentral gyrus and postcentral sulcus
which was used for calculation of the GLI and subsequent extraction of profiles. The corresponding GLI
image of the ROI is shown at a higher magnification in
Fig. 1C. Equidistant profiles 200 �m apart were extracted from the crown of the postcentral gyrus (index
1) to the fundus of the postcentral sulcus (index 97). In

Fig. 1D, the D values of the Mahalanobis distance
function (b � 14) are plotted against the indices which
indicate the positions of the profiles in the cortex. Two
significant maxima are marked with drop lines (P �
0.001; after Bonferroni correction).
In Fig. 2B, the effect of increasing values of b (i.e.,
numbers of adjacent profiles per block) is demonstrated
by processing the same set of profiles as shown in Fig.

(dotted horizontal line at b � 14 corresponds to plot
shown in Fig. 1D). The degree of smoothing increases
with a higher number of profiles per block but the
positions of two significant maxima are remarkably
stable. Across a wide range of b, the maxima indicating
the borders between area 1 and area 2 and between
area 2 and the PPC can be found at similar positions in
the cortex (cf. schematic drawing in Fig. 2B, approximate Talairach plane x ��29 mm).
The positions of these significant maxima can be
reproduced at comparable positions across a sequence
of sagittal sections (distance between adjacent sections
0.9 mm) from the same brain (340/83) (Figs. 2A–2D).
The maximum at index 31 in section 3766 (Fig. 2A, x �
�28 mm) lies close to the caudal shoulder of the postcentral gyrus and corresponds to the maxima at index

3856 (Fig. 2C, x ��30 mm), and 19 in section 3901
(Fig. 2D, x ��31 mm) (cf. schematic drawings). The
maximum at index 62 in section 3766 (Fig. 2A) lies
further down in the depth of the postcentral sulcus and
corresponds to the maxima at index 75 in section 3811
(Fig. 2B), 72 in section 3856 (Fig. 2C), and 82 in section
3901 (Fig. 2D).
The positions of the two significant maxima in the
caudal bank of the postcentral gyrus coincide with
visible changes in cytoarchitecture in the cell-stained
sections. In section 3811 (brain 340/83, cf. Fig. 2B), the
first change in cytoarchitecture is evident close to the
caudal shoulder of the postcentral gyrus. At this position, granular cortex with a columnar arrangement of

coincides with index 75 in section 3811 (cf. Fig. 2B) and

sequence (cf. Figs. 2A–2D).
Mean density profiles (GLI against cortical depth) of
areas 1 and 2 reflect the mean laminar pattern of the
volume density of neurons across layers II through VI
(Fig. 4). In area 2 (Fig. 4B), the mean volume density of
neurons in the middle part of layer III is lower compared to area 1 (Fig. 4A), the density of layer VI neurons decreases more steeply towards the white matter
(reflecting the sharper border between gray and white
matter in area 2), and the infragranular layers (especially layer VI) are narrower in area 2 compared to
area 1.

_Interindividual Variability of Area 2_

Figure 5 shows the topographical variability of area
2 across four different brains (sectioned in a coronal
plane). One section per brain from a comparable rostrocaudal level (approximate Talairach plane y ��29
mm) is depicted schematically in Figs. 5A–5D. Area 2
always occupies the caudal wall of the postcentral gyrus. However, the positions of significant maxima of
the Mahalanobis distance function and corresponding
changes in cytoarchitecture in the cell-stained sections
which represent the rostral border of area 2 (toward
area 1) and its caudal border (towards the PPC) are
topographically variable across different brains. The
rostral border of area 2 may lie within the postcentral
sulcus close to the caudal shoulder of the postcentral
gyrus (Figs. 5A, 5B, and 5D) or it may lie on the
exposed cortical surface towards the crown of the postcentral gyrus (Fig. 5C). Likewise, the caudal border of
2 li l t th f d f th t t l


sulcus (Figs. 5A and 5D) or it may lie somewhat away
from it in the ascending part of the postcentral gyrus
(Figs. 5B and 5C). There are no macroanatomical landmarks, which reliably indicate the positions of the rostral and caudal border of area 2. A similar degree of
interindividual variability is also obvious on a macroanatomical level (Tables 3A and 3B). In maps of the
human cerebral cortex, the postcentral sulcus is typically depicted as a continuous and uninterrupted structure. In our sample of 10 brains, however, this is the
case only in 70% on the right and 40% on the left side.
Two segments of the postcentral sulcus (with a gyral
bridge in between) are observed in 20% (right) and 40%
(left), three segments in 10% (right) and 20% (left). In
20% (right) and 40% (left), the postcentral sulcus
reaches to the mesial surface. In 40% (right) and 30%
(left), it is connected with the Sylvian fissure. The
postcentral and intraparietal sulcus are connected in
90% (right and left). The intraparietal sulcus is continuous in 50% (right) and 70% (left), two segments are
observed in 40% (right) and 30% (left), three segments
in 10% (right) and 0% (left).
This variability in macroanatomy has little influence
on the topography of area 2. Area 2 always occupies the
caudal wall of the postcentral gyrus on the dorsolateral
convexity of the brain. In those cases in which the
intraparietal sulcus is connected with the postcentral
sulcus (90% in the right and left hemisphere), area 2
does not extend into the intraparietal sulcus (Fig. 6D).
The medial end of area 2 may reach to the midline or
there may be a gap of up to several millimeters between its medial end and the midline irrespective of
whether or not the postcentral sulcus reaches to the
mesial cortical surface. We never observed area 2 to lie

end of area 2 may reach to the Sylvian fissure or there
may be a gap of up to several millimeters between its
lateral end and the fissure irrespective of whether or
not the postcentral sulcus is connected with the Sylvian fissure. We never observed area 2 to reach into the
depth of the Sylvian fissure (Fig. 6D). In 30% (right)
and 60% (left), the course of the postcentral sulcus is
interrupted by gyral bridges (Table 3A). This situation,
however, does not interrupt the course of area 2. As can
be seen in Figs. 6C and 6D, area 2 crosses this bridge
(marked by an arrow) and is not separated into two
segments (a photograph of this brain is depicted in
Fig. 1A).

_Spatial Normalization and Population Map of Area 2_

Each 3-D reconstructed histological volume (with the
volume representation of area 2) was then spatially
normalized to the reference brain of the computerized
atlas. The 10 normalized volumes were superimposed
i th 3 D f th f b i d l ti


map was generated for area 2 (Fig. 7; reference brain is
shown in the background). The population map describes, for each voxel, how many brains have a representation of area 2 in this particular voxel. This representation is color coded in a spectral sequence from
dark blue (area 2 is present in only 1 of 10 brains in
this voxel) to dark red (in all 10 brains). Left-right
differences in the topographical relationship between
the central sulcus and the population map of area 2 are
due to left-right differences in the macroanatomy of our
reference brain. This brain is the in vivo MR scan of
one normal human brain (cf. Roland et al., 1994) and
_not a mean brain, cf. MNI-template. The entire volume_
of the population map (i.e., representation of area 2 in
�1 of 10 brains) is: 20,018 mm3 (left), 18,311 mm3

(right), and 38,329 mm3 (left � right). The Talairach
coordinates of the bounding box of the map’s entire
volume are for the left hemisphere: xmedial ��6 mm,

**DISCUSSION**

_Validation of a Cytoarchitectonic Entity in the_
_Caudal Wall of the Postcentral Gyrus_

The cytoarchitecture of the postcentral gyrus has
b t di d l ti th l t t (B d


mann, 1909; von Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Bailey
and von Bonin, 1951; Sarkissov et al., 1955). The areas
delineated by the different investigators in the postcentral gyrus vary both in terms of number and topography. These discrepancies are partly due to interindividual biological variability but they are also the
consequence of the subjectivity that in the past influenced all cytoarchitectonic parcellations (cf. Introduction). In order to exclude this latter confound, we have
used an observer-independent technique to map the
caudal wall of the postcentral gyrus. In our sample of
10 brains, we consistently found a cytoarchitectonically homogeneous entity in this region with a rostral
border close to the caudal shoulder of the postcentral
gyrus and a caudal border close to the fundus of the
postcentral sulcus.
Unfortunately, Brodmann’s publications (1903,
1908, 1909) are not very helpful in classifying this
entity since they contain neither detailed verbal nor
any pictorial descriptions of each area’s cytoarchitectonic features. Instead, he only briefly comments on

(1909) described an area 2 situated in the “caudal part
of the gyrus centralis posterior or the anterior lip of the
sulcus postcentralis.” According to Brodmann, the posterior border of area 2 may sometimes be found caudal
to the fundus of the postcentral sulcus. This is confirmed by our observations, but only in those regions
where the postcentral sulcus is shallow (less than 0.5
cm deep, which is usually the case only close to its
medial and lateral end). In contrast to Brodmann, von
Economo and Koskinas (1925) meticulously described
each area’s cytoarchitectonic features and they also
published photomicrographs. They delineated an area
termed “PD” in the caudal wall of the postcentral gyrus
with cytoarchitectonic features (e.g., prominent pyramids in lower layer III which stand out in size compared to the cells in the other layers) that closely match
our observations.
In the late 1950s Powell and Mountcastle (1959a)
studied the cytoarchitecture of the postcentral gyrus


of the rhesus monkey. Caudal to area 1 they described an area 2 whose cytoarchitectonic features
are similar to the features we found in area 2 in
humans. Powell and Mountcastle wrote: “An increase in the number of large pyramidal cells in the
deeper parts of layer III (. . .) marks the transition
between areas 1 and 2. In layer III the large pyramidal cells come to form quite a compact layer three
to five cells thick (. . .). The superficial half of layer
III becomes slightly less dense (. . .). Layers II and IV
show little appreciable change (. . .)” (Powell and
Mountcastle, 1959a, p. 115).
The entity that we delineated with our observerindependent technique is very similar to Brodmann’s
area 2, to area PD as described by von Economo and
Koskinas, and also to area 2 defined by Powell and
Mountcastle in the rhesus monkey. We adopted Brodmann’s nomenclature since it is more widely used and
termed the entity “area 2.”

_Area 2_

We found considerable topographical variability in
the mediolateral extent of area 2. In some cases, the
medial end of area 2 reaches to the midline whereas in
other cases a gap of up to several millimeters was
found between its medial end and the midline. Similar
variability was detected in the topographical relation
between the lateral end of area 2 and the Sylvian
fissure. Quite unexpectedly, we did not find area 2 on
the mesial cortical surface in the depth of the midline.
As to this surprising result, conflicting data can be
found in the “classical” cytoarchitectonic literature in
humans: Brodmann (1909) and Sarkissov et al. (1955)
found area 2 on the mesial surface whereas von
Economo and Koskinas (1925) did not. In contrast,
many studies in macaques (Vogt and Vogt, 1919; Powell and Mountcastle, 1959b; Burton and Jones, 1976;
Pons et al., 1985) described area 2 not only on the
cortical convexity but also on the mesial surface. At
variance with these latter results, a recent study by
Lewis et al. (1999) did not find area 2 on the mesial
surface of the macaque brain. However, Lewis et al.
excluded all transition regions between area 2 and its
cytoarchitectonic neighbors. This approach yielded
a—what the authors termed—“lower bound estimate”
of the extent of area 2. The resulting map showed an
relatively small area surrounded by a cytoarchitectonic
“no man’s land”—a rather unsatisfying situation since
two adjacent cortical areas should always have a common border. To sum up, the absence of area 2 from the
mesial cortical surface in humans is in contrast with its
extent in the macaque brain. To what extent this discrepancy reflects inter-observer differences in the
structural delineation of area 2 or interspecies differences in its functional organization remains to be elucidated.
We also found topographical variability in the rostrocaudal extent of area 2. In some cases, the rostral
end of area 2 reaches almost to the crown of the postcentral gyrus whereas in other cases it is hidden in the
depth of the postcentral sulcus (cf. Figs. 2 and 5).
Similar variability is obvious in the topographical relation between the caudal end of area 2 and the fundus
of the postcentral sulcus. The postcentral sulcus is
connected with the intraparietal sulcus in 90% (right
and left hemisphere) in our sample and in 64% (right)
and 72% (left) in Ono et al.’s (1990) sample (cf. Table
3A). We found that in these cases area 2 remains
anchored to the postcentral sulcus and does not extend
into the intraparietal sulcus. As to this result, conflicting data can be found in the “classical” cytoarchitectonic literature in humans: Brodmann (1909) and von
Economo and Koskinas (1925) found an extension of
area 2 or area PD into the intraparietal sulcus whereas
S ki _l (1955) did_ t Th i l d b t i


macaque’s intraparietal sulcus. According to some authors (Vogt and Vogt, 1919; Peele, 1942; Powell and
Mountcastle, 1959b; Burton and Jones, 1976; Vogt and
Pandya, 1978) area 2 extends caudally to a varying
degree into the intraparietal sulcus. However, in more
recent studies (Shanks et al., 1985; Pearson and Powell, 1985; Pons and Kaas, 1986; Burton and Fabri,
1995; Lewis et al., 1999) area 2 was not found in this
sulcus. What are the reasons for these differences? A
key factor is the subjective nature of microstructural
parcellation. Most of the authors cited above wrote that
they had difficulties in unequivocally defining the caudal border of area 2. As a consequence, different investigators used different criteria and published maps
which varied especially in the topography of the caudal
border of area 2. In this study we attempted to solve
this problem by delineating statistically significant
borders with an observer-independent technique. Our
results support those authors who did not find area 2 in
the intraparietal sulcus. Interindividual biological
variability is another reason for the discrepancies between the maps. Unfortunately, these cortical maps
were published as sketches in a two-dimensional print
format and a spatial reference system is not available
which makes it difficult (especially in humans) to superimpose and compare these maps with each other.
Considerable microanatomical variability, however,
does exist. When histological volumes (with the volume
representations of cortical areas) are spatially normalized in such a way that macroanatomical variability is
minimized, each area’s variability (as expressed in the
population map) is almost exclusively microstructural
in nature (cf. Geyer et al., 2000). This remarkable
degree of microstructural variability of area 2 is shown
in the population map in Fig. 7.
In schematic drawings of the human cerebral cortex,
the postcentral sulcus is typically depicted as a continuous and uninterrupted structure. The “classical”
maps of Brodmann (1909), von Economo and Koskinas
(1925), and many other investigators follow this simplification and depict both the postcentral sulcus and
area 2 as a continuous mediolateral structure. No comments (neither verbally nor in pictorial format) are
made on the course of area 2 when the postcentral
sulcus is interrupted by a gyral bridge running between the postcentral gyrus and the posterior parietal
cortex. In fact, our observations show that this case is
by no means a rare variant. In our sample of 10 brains,
the postcentral sulcus is interrupted by one (or even
more) gyral bridges in 30% (right hemisphere) and 60%
(left hemisphere). Ono et al. (1990) found in a sample of
25 brains interruptions of the postcentral sulcus in
56% in the right and 52% in the left hemisphere. As to
the course of area 2 in such a case, one can imagine two
possibilities: the area is either separated (just as the
l ) i t t t b th ti l b id it i

edge, this topological problem has never been addressed in the published literature. We found in our
sample that when the postcentral sulcus is interrupted
by a gyral bridge, area 2 crosses this bridge and is not
separated into two segments (cf. Fig. 6C and 6D, arrowhead).

_Relationship between Structure and Function_

The population map of area 2 may be used to interpret functional data on a more valid basis. The extent
of area 2 can be defined as a VOI and matched with
activation clusters in the postcentral region. For area
2, this has been done for the first time in a study by
Bodegard et al. (2001, in press). Subjects had to perform different somatosensory tasks with their right
hands: (i) passive tactile discrimination of ellipsoids
and different brush stroke velocities, (ii) discrimination of edge length, curvature, and roughness, and (iii)
active tactile discrimination of shapes. The authors
demonstrated with PET and a subsequent cytoarchitectonic VOI analysis that area 2 was significantly
more activated by shape and surface curvature
changes than by texture, brush velocity, and edge
length discrimination. In contrast, areas 3b and 1 were
activated by all stimuli without any statistical differences. The preference of area 2 for the computation of
shape and surface curvature changes is in accordance
with findings in monkeys (Randolph and Semmes,
1974; Carlson, 1981; Iwamura et al., 1983b), and supports the concept that also in humans area 2 is involved in a higher level of cortical somatosensory processing.
Therefore, a microstructural population map of area
2 as shown in this study is a promising way to learn
more about its role in somatosensory processing in
humans. When superimposed with statistical activation maps from PET or fMRI experiments or with
equivalent current dipoles from MEG or EEG experiments, such a map should give a more valid answer to
the question whether or not area 2 is being activated by
a specific somatosensory task.
