**INTRODUCTION**

The cytoarchitectonically defined area 41 of Brodmann (1909) represents the putative anatomical correlate of the human primary auditory cortex (PAC). It is
located in the depth of the Sylvian fissure where it
occupies most of Heschl’s gyrus (HG). According to
Brodmann (1909), area 41 is surrounded caudolaterally by area 42, rostrolaterally by area 22, and medially
by area 52 (Fig. 1) on the superior temporal plane.
Although HG is usually defined as the site of PAC,
existing cytoarchitectonic parcellation schemes of PAC
vary among different available maps. While Brodmann
(1909) described only one koniocortical area (area 41)
as PAC, others have identified two areas within the
primary auditory cortex (Economo and Koskinas, 1925;
Sarkissov et al., 1955; Galaburda and Sanides, 1980).
Moreover, the size and exact location of areal borders
and anterior-to-posterior or medial-to-lateral distribution of these areas differ between the studies, and the
intersubject variability of cytoarchitecture, size, and
topography was not analyzed (Lashley and Clark,
1946). It is not known to what degree divergent anatomical patterns may reflect interindividual variability
or only interobserver differences caused by the highly
observer-dependent methods of classical architectonic
studies. The classical maps do not include data on
variations in topography or size of PAC between the
hemispheres and/or the sexes. Finally, the 2-D presentation in highly schematized maps of the previous cytoarchitectonic parcellations are of limited use for comparisons with functional imaging studies based on 3-D
data sets from living human brains.
Noninvasive in vivo analysis of auditory perception
has been accomplished with electroencephalography
(Celesia, 1976; Liegeois-Chauvel et al., 1991, 1994),
magnetoencephalography (Reite et al., 1982; Romani et
_al., 1982a; Hari et al., 1984; Pantev et al., 1989a; Hari,_

1991; Scheuneman et al., 1991; Yoshiura et al., 1995;
Langner et al., 1997), and functional imaging, including magnetic resonance imaging (Binder et al., 1994;
Strainer et al., 1997; Scheich et al., 1998; Schmid et al.,
1998; Talavage et al., 1999). Most of these studies have
demonstrated that primary auditory functions such as
the response to pure tones and to acoustic frequency
patterns map onto the medial two-thirds of HG. Several studies provided evidence for a tonotopic organization of the functionally defined primary auditory cortex (A1) with responses to low-frequency stimuli
originating more laterally and high-frequency stimuli
originating more medially (Romani et al., 1982b; Hari
_et al., 1984; Lauter et al., 1985; Pantev et al., 1989b,_
1995; Yamamoto et al., 1992; Tiitinen et al., 1993; Reite
_et al., 1994; Verkindt et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1996;_
Talavage et al., 1997; Ottaviani et al., 1997; Bilecen et
_al., 1998)._
In contrast to the established functional lateralization of language, asymmetries following acoustic stimulation are still a matter of discussion (Matsumiya et
_al., 1972; Reite et al., 1981; Lauter, 1992; McFadden,_
1993; Polyakov and Pratt, 1995; Poeppel et al., 1996;
Belin et al., 1998; Zouridakis et al., 1998; Nicholls,
1998; Pantev et al., 1998a).
Since a considerable intersubject variability in size,
shape, and topography of the transverse gyri has been
described (Steinmetz et al., 1989; Thompson et al.,
1996; Penhune et al., 1996; Leonard et al., 1998), this
variability of macroscopical landmarks should be
taken into account in an architectonic analysis and
when interpreting putative structural–functional correlations. It is not known whether the functionally
defined PAC maps precisely onto the cytoarchitectoni

regions indicate that microstructurally defined (i.e.,
cytoarchitecture) cortical areas may precisely parallel
functionally defined areas (Merzenich et al., 1978;
Kaas et al., 1979; Iwamura et al., 1994; Roland and
Zilles, 1998). However, a reliable and sufficiently precise localization of the borders of cytoarchitectonic areas on the basis of gyral or sulcal landmarks is problematic as previously demonstrated (Rademacher et
_al.,_ 1993; Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995;
Amunts et al., 1999). Thus, a mapping of cytoarchitectonic and functional images to a common reference
space is required for further testing the hypothesis of
architectonic/functional parallels and the value of macroscopical landmarks for this question.
We used a recently described observer-independent
cytoarchitectonic method (Schleicher et al., 1999) for
the reliable definition of PAC and its areal borders. In
contrast to classical architectonic studies based on
pure visual inspection and individual pattern recognition capabilities, this method uses quantitative data
and multivariate statistics to provide reproducibility,
reliability, and precision of the results. The measurements were performed with an automated microscopic
scanning and image analysis procedure, which enables
the detection of the sites of statistically significant
changes in laminar distribution of volume densities of
cell bodies, the most important cytoarchitectonic criterion (Zilles et al., 1995; Geyer et al., 1996, 1999;
Amunts et al., 1999). The cytoarchitectonically defined
areas and their borders were reconstructed three-dimensionally and visualized in the stereotaxic space of a
reference brain (Roland and Zilles 1994, 1996, 1998).
This approach also provides a tool to calculate probability maps of PAC by superimposing the PACs of dif

dard brain (Mazziotta et al., 1995) (see companion
article by J. Rademacher et al.).
The goals of our study are the: (i) quantitative cytoarchitectonic definition of PAC and its subdivisions, (ii)
analysis of side and gender differences in cytoarchitecture, and (iii) mapping of PAC and its subdivisions to
the in vivo format of the standard reference brain.

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

**Subjects**

Ten adult human postmortem brains were obtained
from the body donor program of the Anatomical Institute of the University of Du¨sseldorf in accordance with
legal requirements (Table 1). None of the subjects had
clinical records of previous neurological or psychiatric
disorders. Handedness of the subjects was unknown.

**MR Imaging and Histological Processing**
**of Postmortem Brains**

The complete undissected brains were fixed in 4%
formalin or in Bodian’s solution (mixture of formalin,
glacial acetic acid, and ethanol). The postmortem delay
was between 8 and 24 h. MR imaging of each postmortem brain was performed with a Siemens 1.5-T scanner
(Erlangen, Germany) with a T1-weighted FLASH sequence covering the entire brain (flip angle 40°, repetition time TR � 40 ms, echo time TE � 5 ms for each
image) for the documentation of brain morphology and
dimensions before histological processing (Roland and
Zilles, 1994). Spatial resolution was 1 � 1 � 1.17 mm.
After MR imaging, all brains were dehydrated in a
graded series of alcohol, embedded in paraffin, and
serially sectioned in the coronal plane (20-�m-thick
sections). Every 15th section was silver stained for
demonstrating cell bodies, i.e., cytoarchitecture


titative cytoarchitectonic analysis and 3-D reconstructions of the brains (see below).

**Measurements of Cell Volume Densities (GLI)**

Cortical regions large enough to include PAC and
neighboring areas were interactively marked as regions of interest (ROI). Within each ROI, quantification of cell volume densities was performed using the
gray level index (GLI) procedure (Schleicher and Zilles,
1990; Schleicher et al., 1999). In brief, each ROI was
completely covered by a continuous, mosaic-like pattern and scanned using TV frames 524 � 524 �m in
size, 512 � 512-pixel spatial resolution, and 8-bit gray
resolution at low microscopical resolution (Planapo
4.0 � 1.25; Zeiss, Germany). From each TV frame, a
binary image is generated by adaptive thresholding
(Castleman, 1979) which is further subdivided by a
grid of k � _k measuring fields. The size of each mea-_
suring field defines the spatial resolution of the scanning procedure. In the present paper, the GLI (0% �
GLI � 100%) is the areal fraction of cellular profiles in
a measuring field of 32 � 32 �m. The GLI is correlated
with the volume density of neurons (Wree et al., 1982).
Because the GLI is a ratio of the areal projections of
two volumes (cell bodies and neuropil), it is not distorted by histological processing as both compartments
are expected to shrink to the same degree (Amunts et
_al., 1999)._

**Observer-Independent Localization of Areal Borders**

The quantitative cytoarchitectonic procedure for determining areal borders was already published in detail (Schleicher et al., 1999). Therefore, only a brief
description of the principles will follow here. Changes
of the GLI extending from layer II to the gray/white
matter boundary were registered vertically to the cor

-----

Each traverse indicates an individual GLI profile (ordinate, cell volume density (%); abscissa, total cortical
thickness normalized to 100%).
For a quantitative analysis of the cytoarchitecture
represented by the shape of GLI profiles, each individual profile was characterized by a set of 10 features
(feature vector), comprising the mean GLI value
(meany.o � mean cell volume density averaged over all
cortical layers), the center of gravity in x direction
(meanx.o), the standard deviation (SD.o), the skewness
(skew.o), the kurtosis (kurt.o) of each profile curve, and
the analogous parameters for the first derivative
(meany.d, meanx.d, SD.d, skew.d, kurt.d). These features were calculated as central moments by treating
the profile and its differential quotient as frequency
polygons. The data from all profiles of a ROI were
standardized to Z scores in order to assign equal
weight to each of the features.
The Mahalanobis distances (D2) between the feature
vectors of the profiles located in two neighboring cortical sectors were calculated. The width of a sector was
varied systematically so that each sector comprised
between 8 (1024 �m) and 24 profiles (3072 �m). D2

quantifies the degree of dissimilarity in laminar pattern (difference in cytoarchitecture) between two
neighboring sectors. D2 was calculated for all sequential positions of the two neighboring cortical sectors, if
both sectors were shifted simultaneously like sliding
windows by 128 �m to the next position, i.e., the distance between two individual profiles. This procedure
results in several sets of Mahalanobis distances for the
systematically varied widths (see above) of the cortical
sectors (Schleicher et al., 1999) and, thus, in calculations of D2 at varying levels of spatial resolution. Positions of profiles were indexed from 1 (starting position) to n (final position), where n was the total number
of profiles per ROI. D2 values were plotted along the
positions 1 to n resulting in a Mahalanobis distance
function. Maxima of this function D2 indicate large
differences in cytoarchitecture between two neighboring sectors. In contrast to the Euclidean approach, the
Mahalanobis approach to localize cytoarchitectonic
areal borders has a pronounced sensitivity to abrupt
changes in the laminar pattern, which are expected at
the border between two cortical areas. It is less sensitive to gradual changes in cytoarchitecture caused by
cortical folding (Schleicher et al., 1999). Since only
ROIs showing a clear six-layered cortex were used for
the observer-independent localization of areal borders,
only gradual changes in cytoarchitecture were induced
by cortical folding. Thus there is no indication that the
Mahalanobis approach is affected by cortical folding in
this application. The Mahalanobis distance can be
tested using the Hotelling T2 test for proving the significance of a difference between the mean vectors of


values for multiple comparisons (Dixon et al., 1988).
Significant maxima define putative cytoarchitectonic
areal borders, which were selected according to the
following definitions: (i) discard maxima with P � 0.05
in the Hotelling T2 test (statistical criterion); (ii) accept
only the absolutely highest maximum as a putative
areal border, if two or more, significant (P value �
0.05) maxima are spatially separated by less than the
actual size of one sector (resolution criterion); and (iii)
consider only those maxima as areal borders which
were found at comparable positions across a series of at
least three adjoining histological sections (consistency
criterion).

**Quantitative Cytoarchitecture of Cortical Areas**

In each brain and each cytoarchitectonically identified area, 10 to 15 individual GLI profiles were randomly selected and averaged to generate a mean GLI
profile curve, which represents the areal- and brainspecific cytoarchitectonic organization. For areas
Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1 a total number of 60 mean GLI
profiles resulted (3 mean GLI profiles for the three
areas � 2 hemispheres � 10 brains).
By projecting the mean GLI profile curve of an area
onto the corresponding histological image via a drawing tube attached to a microscope, the borders between
cortical layers were identified by visual inspection.
This procedure enables the measurement of relative
(total cortical thickness was normalized to 100%, see
above) thickness and cell volume density (GLI) of each
cortical layer. Interareal, side, and gender differences
in total and lamina-specific GLI and in relative thickness of each layer were tested by analysis of variance
(ANOVA) using a repeated-measures design. Significant differences were further analyzed by paired t tests
(Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons).

**Cytoarchitectonic Variability of Cortical Areas**

_Intersubject Variability of Cytoarchitecture_
_of a Distinct Cortical Area_

Between-subject dissimilarity of the laminar pattern
of the same cytoarchitectonic area was measured by
calculating Euclidean distances between two sets of
profiles of the same area sampled from all possible
pairs of different brains in the total sample of 10
brains; i.e., feature vectors of individual GLI profiles of
corresponding areas between all different brains were
compared. In contrast to the border-locating procedure
using the Mahalanobis distance, we calculated Euclidean distances as a measure of dissimilarity, since the
Euclidean distance is the distance between two centroids of p-dimensional clusters and is not affected by
the degree of variability within clusters. Mahalanobis

pair of sets of profiles. In our sample of 10 brains, 45
distance values between all unique pairs of brains were
calculated for each area. The average of these 45 values
was defined as the “intersubject distance” of an area.
High intersubject distances indicated a high degree of
dissimilarity between the same set of cortical areas in
different brains, i.e., high degree of intersubject cytoarchitectonic variability.

_Interareal Variations of Cytoarchitecture in a Subject_

To address the question whether intersubject cytoarchitectonic variability can obscure differences between areas in individual brains, we measured interareal dissimilarities of the area-specific laminar
patterns between two different areas of the same brain.
We calculated Euclidean distances for all possible
unique pairs of areas Te1.1, Te1.0, and Te1.2 and one
neighboring, non-primary auditory area (Brodmann
area 52, TI1 in the present study). This approach produces six different comparisons of areas and thus six
distance values in each brain. Corresponding interareal distances were averaged over the sample of 10
brains (interareal distances). Interareal distances were
compared with a “reference distance,” i.e., the grand
average distance calculated from all the intersubject
distances of the cortical areas included in the actual
comparison. Interareal distances which are lower than
the reference distance indicate that interareal variations of the laminar pattern can be obscured by intersubject differences between corresponding cortical areas. Higher interareal than intersubject differences
indicate that the cytoarchitectonic pattern of a given
area is robust across individuals and not obscured by
intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture.

**Mapping to a Spatial Reference System**

Position and extent of areas Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1
in the histological sections were mapped to a spatial
reference system, which is represented by an in vivo
acquired 3-D MR data set of an individual brain with
no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases (Roland and Zilles, 1994; Geyer et al., 1999; Amunts et al.,
1999, 2000). For this purpose, the histological sections
were digitized and 3-D reconstructed (histological volume). Mapping of the histological volumes to the corresponding MR volumes, which were obtained prior to
embedding and sectioning, allowed the correction of
deformations inevitably resulting from the histological
procedure. This matching was performed by using both
linear and nonlinear transformations (Schormann et
_al., 1993, 1995, 1996). Finally, the postmortem brains_
were warped to the MR volume of the standard spatial
reference system using affine transformations (Schormann and Zilles, 1997, 1998). The affine transforma

individual brain anatomy. The spatially normalized
brains were orientated in the AC–AP plane (Talairach
and Tournoux, 1988). The positions and extents of the
cytoarchitectonically defined primary auditory areas
were traced interactively onto the digitized histological
sections using an image analyzer system (KS400). The
labeled cytoarchitectonic areas were 3-D reconstructed
and spatially normalized using the same transformations as were applied for the whole brains. In a final
step, the spatially normalized areas were also oriented
in the AC–AP plane (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988).
We studied the relationship between macroanatomical landmarks and cytoarchitectonically defined areal
borders in each affine-transformed brain by comparing
the Talairach coordinates of the framing sulci of the
Heschl gyrus with the coordinates of the cytoarchitectonically defined borders of the whole primary auditory
cortex (Te1).

**RESULTS**

**Descriptive Cytoarchitecture**

Region Te1 (Brodmann area 41) is located on the
Heschl gyrus and is microscopically identifiable as a
highly granular cortex (koniocortex), which is surrounded by less granular cortices, areas Te2, Te3, and
TI1. Te1 is characterized by the occurrence of small
granular cells throughout the entire cortical depth,
small-sized pyramidal cells of layer IIIc, a prominent
layer IV, and a relatively cell-sparse layer V. Medially,
Te1 is bordered by the insular cortex and anterolaterally by area Te3 (part of Brodmann area 22). In comparison to Te1, area Te3 is characterized by a less
granular appearance, the occurrence of larger pyramidal cells in layer IIIc, smaller width of layer IV, and a
higher cell density in layer V. Rostrally, Te1 is bordered by the temporoinsular area TI1 (Brodmann
parainsular area 52). The latter is characterized by a
wider supragranular (especially layer III) compared to
infragranular layers, narrow layer IV, and high cell
densities in layers V and VI. Caudolaterally, Te1 is
bordered by area Te2 (Brodmann area 42), which is
less granular than Te1 and contains large pyramidal
cells in layer IIIc.

**Areal Borders of Te1**

The areal borders of Te1 with the surrounding areas
TI1, Te2, and Te3 were defined in each individual
brain. Figure 2 shows an example of the observerindependent definition of areal borders between Te2,

between Te3/Te1.2, Te1.2/Te1.0, and Te1.0/Te1.1.


_Subdivision of Te1_

This method detected also cytoarchitectonic changes
within Te1, indicating subdivisions of the primary auditory cortex Te1 into three areas (as an example see
Figs. 2A and 2B with line b and Fig. 2C with an
arrowhead indicating the position of maximum b).
Maximum b subdivides Te1 into areas Te1.0 and Te1.2.
The border between Te1.0 and Te1.1 is shown in Fig. 3.
In each hemisphere, Te1 could be consistently subdivided into three areas, Te1.1, Te1.0, and Te1.2, following each other in the medial-to-lateral direction (Fig.
3A).
After the observer-independent definition of areal
borders we looked for characteristic cytoarchitectonic
features of the three areas (Figs. 3 and 4). The centrally located area Te1.0 is characterized by the high

boring areas Te1.2 and Te1.1, i.e., the thickest layer IV
and particularly small-sized IIIc pyramidal cells. In
strictly orthogonally oriented sections, the arrangement of neuronal perikarya in vertical cell columns is
found most clearly in area Te1.0 (rain-shower formation of von Economo and Koskinas, 1925). The medially
situated area Te1.1 can be characterized by a less
distinct cortical layering and the appearance of single,
medium-sized pyramidal cells in layer IIIc. Laterally,
the granular area Te1.2 shows a broad layer III, which
contains clusters of medium-sized IIIc pyramids. This
feature can be also seen in the neighboring nonprimary
auditory areas.

**Quantitative Cytoarchitecture**

4, and 7). The differences in cytoarchitecture between
the three primary auditory areas can be recognized in
each brain (interareal variability). Between subjects,
variations of the laminar patterns of corresponding
areas were observed as well (intersubject variability).
To study the interareal and intersubject cytoarchitectonic differences, laminar cell volume densities of
each primary auditory area were represented by a corresponding mean GLI profile curve. Figure 5 shows the
mean GLI profiles of area Te1.0 in 10 left hemispheres
and of areas Te1.2 and Te1.1 in a single left hemisphere. A comparison of the mean GLI profiles (solid
lines) of Te1.0 reveals the interindividual variability in
cytoarchitecture of an identical area (Fig. 5). The
dashed lines (standard error of the mean) demonstrate
the intraindividual variability of GLI profiles in Te1.0
(for all cases) and in Te1.1 and Te1.2 (selected representative cases). Each primary auditory area has a
high cell density in layers II, lower III, IV, and, to a


density in upper layer III and layer V (represented by
consistent minima of the GLI profile curves). Interareal and intersubject differences are reflected by differences in shape and the occurrence of inconsistent
maxima and minima in the mean GLI profile curves.
Mean areal and laminar cell volume densities and
layer thickness were extracted from corresponding
mean GLI profile curves of each area (Tables 2 and 3)
and tested for interareal, side, and gender differences
(ANOVA, repeated-measure design). While there are
no gender differences in our sample, significant interactions between the within-factors area and the side
are found. Mean areal cell volume densities show significant higher values in Te1.1 compared to Te1.2 in
the left, but not in the right, hemisphere, caused by
significant differences in layers IV, V, and VI (paired t
test, df � 9, P � 0.05). Higher cell volume densities are
found on the left side in areas Te1.0 and Te1.1 and on
the right side in area Te1.2, but these differences were
not significant (paired t test, df � 9, P � 0.05) (Fig. 6).
Laminar thickness in the left hemisphere shows significant interareal differences in layer III (paired t test,
_df �_ 6, P � 0.05), with higher values in area Te1.2 than
in areas Te1.0 and Te1.1 (Fig. 7A). No significant differences can be detected in the right hemisphere. In
layer IV of both hemispheres, significantly higher
thickness are found in area Te1.0 than in areas Te1.2
and Te1.1 (paired t test, df � 6, P � 0.05) (Fig. 7B).

**Cytoarchitectonic Variability of Cortical Areas**

The intersubject variability of the GLI profiles of
each of the auditory areas (Fig. 8A) is highest in area
Te1.0 of the left hemisphere (Euclidean distance 2.59)
and lowest in area Te1.2 of the left hemisphere (Euclidean distance 1.68). Left–right comparisons of the
intersubject differences in cytoarchitecture show a
larger variability in area Te1.0 than in areas Te1.2 and
Te1.1. This indicates that the left area Te1.0 varies to
a higher degree between subjects than the right area
Te1.0. The average Euclidean distance calculated from
the intersubject distances of all three primary auditory
areas is 2.06 on the left side and 1.84 on the right side
(“grand average distance” � mean of all comparisons,
black line in Fig. 8A).
_Interareal differences in cytoarchitecture between_
four areas (six comparisons of two of four areas) of each
hemisphere in the sample of 10 brains are shown Fig.
8B. Since this type of analysis is based on distances
between pairs of areas, no absolute positions of the
areas in the p-dimensional feature space nor any visualization for their mutual arrangement can be derived
from the data. However, multidimensional scaling
(Henery et al., 1998) is an adequate tool to visualize the

Te1.1, Te1.2, and TI1. In both hemispheres, interareal
distances between primary auditory areas (Te1.0,
Te1.1, and Te1.2) on the one hand and the nonprimary
auditory area (TI1) on the other hand are larger than
interareal distances between the different primary auditory areas.
To demonstrate the Euclidean distances in cytoarchitecture between each possible interareal comparison in both hemispheres, the interareal differences in
cytoarchitecture between the three primary auditory
areas averaged over the sample of 10 brains are lower
than the intersubject reference distance (grand average of all possible comparisons between primary and
nonprimary auditory areas) (Fig. 8C). Thus, interareal
differences between primary auditory areas can be obscured by intersubject variations of their laminar pattern. In contrast, the distances between the primary
areas on one side and the nonprimary auditory area
TI1 on the other side are higher. These findings indicate that the cytoarchitecture of the three primary
auditory areas is more similar and, thus, comprises a
nearly related set of cytoarchitectonic areas (“cytoarchitectonic family”), i.e., the primary auditory cortex
Te1.

**Macroanatomical Topography and Spatial**
**Reference System**

In all hemispheres, Te1 can be located on HG. In the
depth of the Sylvian fissure, the medial origin of HG is


separated from the insular cortex by the circular sulcus, while the lateral border of HG cannot be defined by
macroanatomical landmarks. HG always separates the
supratemporal plane into a rostral and a caudal part,
the planum polare and the planum temporale, respectively (for an example, see Fig. 9). The anterior border
of HG is consistently marked by the first transverse
temporal sulcus. The posterior border of HG is frequently obscured by anatomical variations. Two frequent patterns (“duplications”) have been described in
the literature (Pfeifer, 1920; Penhune et al., 1996):
either the crown of HG is incompletely intended by the
intermediate sulcus or there is a complete duplication
resulting in two transverse gyri which are separated by
the second transverse temporal sulcus (Heschl’s sulcus). In our sample of 10 brains, incomplete duplications of HG are found in 5 of 20 hemispheres and
complete duplications in 6 of 20 hemispheres. Thus,
the localization of Te1 based on macroanatomical landmarks is seriously impaired by these gyral variations
and the difficulties in identification. Especially the medial-to-lateral extent of Te1 and its areas cannot be
precisely defined by gyral features or other landmarks.
Anterior and posterior cytoarchitectonic borders also
do not show a reliable association with macroanatomical landmarks. Moreover, comparisons of the Talairach
coordinates of the transverse sulci and those of the
borders of Te1 show significant discrepancies between

**DISCUSSION**

In contrast to classical cytoarchitectonic observations which rely on visual inspection of histological
sections (Brodmann, 1909; Economo and Koskinas,
1925), the present cytoarchitectonic study is based on
an observer-independent method for the detection of
areal borders and quantification of cytoarchitectonic
variability (Amunts et al., 1999). This approach permits statistical testing of the significance of areal borders and does not depend on individual pattern recognition abilities necessary for the classical method. The
definition of borders by the novel technique is based on
the statistical analysis of multivariate distance functions analogous to statistics in functional brain imaging studies in which significant activations are revealed by statistical parametric mapping (Friston et
_al., 1996). This architectonic technique has recently_
been applied to the analysis of the primary motor,
somatosensory, and visual cortices as well as Broca’s
region (Geyer et al., 1996, 1999; Amunts et al., 1999,
2000). The major aspects of cytoarchitectonic organization are represented by cell body volume density (GLI)
profiles. Since the GLI profiles, registered in distinct
cortical areas, are architectonic “fingerprints” of the
respective area (Hudspeth et al., 1976), laminar cell
density and layer thickness can be extracted and statistically tested for gender-, side-, and area-dependent


auditory system needs a precise and reliable architectonic map for the anatomical interpretation of activation clusters after auditory stimulation. The present
study demonstrates sharp borders of the putative functional primary auditory cortex, the koniocortical region
Te1, that were in good agreement with results obtained
by pure visual inspection for Brodmann’s area 41
(Brodmann, 1909) and von Economo’s and Koskinas’
(1925) areas TC and TD as far as the topography can be
derived from the 2-D schematic drawings of these publications. Moreover, the observer-independent detection of cytoarchitectonic borders reveals a significant
architectonical heterogeneity of the primary auditory
cortex Te1. Three statistically distinct cytoarchitectonic areas, i.e., areas Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1, can be
localized for the first time in the medial-to-lateral direction. While only subtle changes in the laminar patterns are recognizable, which are difficult to localize by
pure visual inspection, quantitative analysis of the cytoarchitecture provides reliable areal borders in all 10

areas of the left and right hemispheres show lower mutual distances
than each of them with the nonprimary area TI1. Thus, Te1.0, Te1.1,
and Te1.2 comprise a family of architectonically nearly related areas
(i.e., the areas of the primary auditory cortex Te1), although they
differ significantly in their laminar patterns as shown in Figs. 3, 5,
and 6. (C) Means and standard deviations of interareal Euclidean

brains analyzed. The three primary auditory areas are
mapped to a spatial reference system, i.e., the standard
brain (see Materials and Methods). This step is a pre

article by J. Rademacher et al.). The question of
whether activation clusters are related to specific
structural entities can be answered only if such architectonically defined borders have been defined.
Areas Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1 share the typical features of a primary sensory cortical area, i.e., small
granular cells across the entire cortical ribbon, relatively small pyramidal cells in layer IIIc, a prominent
width of layer IV, and a relative cell-sparse layer V
(Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Galaburda and
Sanides, 1980; Rademacher et al., 1993). Quantitative
comparisons of laminar thickness reveal significant interareal differences for the thickness of layers III and
IV. Granular layer IV is widest in area Te1.0, which
also shows the highest density of granular cells compared with other cortical layers. Thus, we interpret
area Te1.0 as the koniocortical core field. The layer

specific interareal differences are probably indicating
quantitative differences in thalamocortical projections
between the three primary auditory areas, since layer
IV is the major target of the ascending projections from
the medial geniculate body. Medial area Te1.1 and
lateral area Te1.2 are less granular than area Te1.0.
While this subdivision of Te1 into three areas is in
contrast to Brodmann’s map (1909), other subparcellations of the primary auditory cortex have been re

Sanides (1980) were recognized in the medial-to-lateral
direction on HG. Others have found much more extensive cytoarchitectonic subparcellations of the primary
auditory areas with up to 11 types of granular cortices
located on HG (Economo and Horn, 1930). However,
these extensive parcellations could not be reproduced
by us. It remains questionable whether they are consistently and reliably demonstrable cortical entities in
a sample of different human brains. However, a consistent aspect of all these cytoarchitectonic maps is the
description of a core region which has a more granular
appearance than the remaining PAC. This region is
comparable to area Te1.0. Medially neighboring areas
have been characterized by the “fogging” of the cortical
layering and by the occurrence of medium-sized pyra

area Te1.1. The cytoarchitectonic region at the lateral
border of HG—area TBC of von Economo and Koskinas
(1925)—was described as a transitional zone between
the primary auditory and the nonprimary areas. This
area resembles area Te1.2 in the present study.
This brief discussion shows also that comparisons
between previous studies is difficult, because of observer-dependent, nonquantitative criteria (Zilles, 1990)
and the lack of spatial normalization procedures used
in these studies. The major advantage of the present
approach is that our maps can be easily compared with
any future quantitative cytoarchitectonic study in a
common spatial reference system. Moreover, the
method of observer-independent localization of areal
borders can also be applied to myeloarchitectonic and
receptor architectonic studies offering a multimodal
characterization of cortical architecture (Roland and
Zilles, 1994). Several examples of a combined cyto- and
receptor-architectonic approach demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach (Zilles et al., 1995; Geyer et
_al., 1996; Roland and Zilles, 1996). For the organiza-_
tion of the human primary auditory cortex, this approach will introduce new aspects, since indications of
multimodal heterogeneity were already brought up
from myeloarchitectonic (Beck, 1930; Hopf, 1954), pigmentoarchitectonic (Braak, 1978), acetylcholinesterase
(Hutsler and Gazzaniga, 1996; Rivier and Clarke,
1997), and cytochromoxidase studies (Rivier and
Clarke, 1997; Clarke and Rivier, 1998).
The functional meaning of the three primary auditory areas is not known. Electrophysiologic studies of
the human supratemporal cortex have demonstrated
evoked potentials with shorter amplitudes and higher
latencies within than outside PAC. A recent study (Liegeois Chauvel et al., 1994) differentiated several components of intracerebral middle latency auditoryevoked potentials (MLAEPs; N30, P50, N60, N75)
which were generated in HG with different topographies along the gyrus. N30 is generated in the medial
and P50 in the central part of HG, both activations
being interpreted as responses of the primary auditory
cortex to tone burst. The generator sources of N60 and
N75 are located in the lateral part of HG. Neuromagnetic measurements of the primary auditory response
confirmed the existence of several generator sources
along HG (Yoshiura et al., 1995). Considering the different latencies of the MLAEPS along the mediolateral
axis of HG, medially located area Te1.1 may correspond to the generator source of the early MLAEPs,
area Te1.0 to the generator source of the middle MLAEPs, and area Te1.2 to the generator source of the late
MLAEPs. A tonotopic organization of the PAC with
high frequencies being represented posteromedially
and low frequencies anterolaterally has been demonstrated using magnetoencephalography (Romani et al.,


recordings (Howard et al., 1996), and functional imaging (Lauter et al., 1985; Talavage et al., 1996; Bilecen et
_al., 1998). Posteromedial activity would probably map_
onto area Te1.1 and anterolateral activity would relate
to area Te1.2. Centrally located area Te1.0 would then
relate to those frequencies which characterize human
speech. Recent functional imaging studies of foreground–background decomposition of auditory perception cortex show two field-specific activations of HG,
T1a and T1b (Scheich et al., 1998). These foci of activation probably map on the combined areas Te1.1 and
Te1.0 (T1b) and on area Te1.2 (T1a).
Intersubject variability in cytoarchitecture of cortical areas was repeatedly described (Economo and
Horn, 1930; Bailey and von Bonin, 1951). Since this
may obscure cytoarchitectonic differences between cortical areas, Lashley and Clark (1946) questioned practically all previous cytoarchitectonic attempts of cortical parcellations. Thus, we measured interareal and
intersubject variabilities of the auditory areas and
compared both parameters. As predicted in the literature, the laminar patterns of each of the primary auditory areas showed a considerable variability between
subjects. The highest variability was seen in left area
Te1.0. This will obscure cytoarchitectonic differences
between areas Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.1, if GLI profiles
are averaged across all brains, but does not prevent
parcellation based on GLI profiles for defining the areal
borders in each brain. The generalized criticism of cytoarchitectonic analyses by Lashley and Clark (1946)
is, therefore, not justified.
Moreover, the present study of the auditory cortex
demonstrates larger cytoarchitectonic differences between cortical regions related to different hierarchical
levels (i.e., Te1 versus TI1) within a sensory system
and relatively small differences between areas belonging to the same hierarchical level (i.e., areas Te1.1,
Te1.0, and Te1.2 of the whole primary auditory cortex
Te1).
The cytoarchitectonic variability of the laminar organization is accompanied by a topographic variability
of the areal borders of Te1.2, Te1.0, and Te1.0 relative
to macroanatomical landmarks. This finding is paralleled by a similar variability found in Broca’s region
(Amunts et al., 1999) and in the visual cortex (Amunts
_et al., 2000). Although the primary auditory areas are_
found consistently on HG in the depth of the Sylvian
fissure (class II variability of Rademacher et al., 1993),
the cytoarchitectonic borders of the Te1 region did not
perfectly match the macroanatomical geometry of Heschl’s transverse gyrus (class I variability of Rademacher et al., 1993). The same cytoarchitectonic border
could be localized either in the depth of the transverse
sulcus or at the crown of the transverse gyrus depending on the individual case. Even more striking, the

temporal cortex in other cases. There are no macroscopic features which indicate consistently a cytoarchitectonic border.
The reason for this dissociation of cytoarchitectonic
borders and reliable sulcal landmarks (cf. Fig. 11) is
not known, but it is tempting to speculate about epigenetic influences on the growth of specific cortical
areas in different subjects. Cytoarchitectonic and topographic variability of cortical areas is shaped by interaction of genetic and environmental factors as described for the visual cortex (Hubel and Wiesel, 1977;
Rakic, 1991). The influences of training, experience,
and early phonetic environment were recently studied
in primate and human auditory cortex (Rauschecker,
1999). In humans, macroanatomical variations of HG
visualized by in vivo magnetic resonance imaging were
interpreted as anatomical substrates of behavioral
variations. Furthermore, it has been reported that the
frequency of duplicated Heschl gyri is increased in
families with learning disabilities (Leonard et al.,
1995). Finally, there are hints as to the impact of early
musical training on the development of absolute pitch
and a concomitant expansion of the auditory cortex
(Schlaug et al., 1995; Pantev et al., 1998b). Such genetic and/or epigenetic phenomena point to hitherto
unknown complex and differential influences of auditory function on the expression of gyral and cytoarchitectonic patterns.
In contrast to a large number of reports on interhemispheric asymmetries in the human language areas including the planum temporale (Geschwind and
Levitsky, 1968; Steinmetz et al., 1990; Witelson and
Kigar, 1992; Jacobs et al., 1993; Schlaug et al., 1995)
and cytoarchitectonic area Tpt (Galaburda et al., 1978),
such asymmetries have only rarely been analyzed in
the auditory system where a leftward asymmetry of
cortex (Rademacher et al., 1993) and white matter fiber
tracts (Penhune et al., 1996) may be present in more
than half of all brains. Golgi studies of the primary
auditory cortex have shown larger cortical columns on
the left side with longer distances between columns
and greater dendritic arborization (Seldon, 1981). In
the present paper, we report left–right differences in
volume fraction of cell bodies in the primary auditory
areas Te1.1, Te1.0, and Te1.2. In areas Te1.1 and
Te1.0, cell volume fractions were consistently higher in
the left than in the right hemisphere, while the opposite relation (right � left) was found in area Te1.2.
Significantly higher cell volume densities were found
in Te1.1 compared to Te1.2 in the left, but not in the
right, hemisphere. Such left–right asymmetry of GLI
reflects a higher number of neurons per unit volume in
the hemisphere with the higher GLI values (Wree et
_al., 1982). One may speculate that leftward asymme-_
tries of neuronal density in Te1.0 and Te1.1 may rep

differences in numerical density of neurons in posterior
temporal cortex between men and women have been
proposed as the morphological substrate for gender
differences in cognition, behavior, and language lateralization (Hier et al., 1994; Witelson et al., 1995; Shaywitz et al., 1995). In contrast to the significant interhemispheric differences in GLI, we did not observe
gender differences in GLI or laminar thickness in Te1.
In conclusion, the observer-independent method enables the delineation of three primary auditory areas,
Te1.1, Te1.0, and Te1.2, in the human brain. The intrasubject cytoarchitectonic differences between these
primary auditory areas are significant, but lower than
the intersubject variability of each of these areas. The
cytoarchitectonic differences between the primary auditory areas and a neighboring nonprimary area, TI1,
exceed intersubject variability. We demonstrate that
the borders of Te1 cannot be reliably and precisely
localized on the basis of macroanatomic landmarks and
thus also not on the basis of individual magnetic resonance imaging. There are no sulcal landmarks for their
medial-to-lateral topography of the three areas. Since
for the time being, precise and exact cytoarchitectonic
parcellation cannot be made in living brains, we have
presented a postmortem anatomical analysis of PAC,
which provides the cytoarchitectonic detail needed for
structural–functional comparisons. It takes into account interhemispheric and intersubject differences at
the architectonic level. Furthermore, it provides a basis for further studies of topographic variability of PAC
(see companion article by J. Rademacher et al.). The
present anatomic mapping of PAC provides both a
revision of the classical cytoarchitectonic maps and a
computational methodology for its integration with
structural or functional 3-D data sets from other studies. Such a system will allow one to colocalize a specifically activated area with a distinct cytoarchitectonic
area (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996, 1998; Mazziotta et
_al., 1995; Geyer et al., 1996; Amunts et al., 1999, 2000;_
