Introduction


The basal forebrain contains several interdigitating anatomical structures, including the diagonal band of
Broca, the basal nucleus of Meynert, the ventral striatum, and also cell groups underneath the globus pallidus
that bridge the centromedial amygdala to the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis. Among the cell populations,
the magnocellular, cholinergic corticopetal projection neurons have received particular attention due to their
loss in Alzheimer's disease. In MRI images, the precise delineation of these structures is difficult due to
limited spatial resolution and contrast. Here, using microscopic delineations in ten human postmortem
brains, we present stereotaxic probabilistic maps of the basal forebrain areas containing the magnocellular
cell groups. Cytoarchitectonic mapping was performed in silver stained histological serial sections. The
positions and the extent of the magnocellular cell groups within the septum (Ch1–2), the horizontal limb of
the diagonal band (Ch3), and in the sublenticular part of the basal forebrain (Ch4) were traced in highresolution digitized histological sections, 3D reconstructed, and warped to the reference space of the MNI
single subject brain. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic maps in the MNI brain shows the intersubject
variability of the various Ch compartments and their stereotaxic position relative to other brain structures.
Both the right and left Ch4 regions showed significantly smaller volumes when age was considered as a
covariate. Probabilistic maps of compartments of the basal forebrain magnocellular system are now available
as an open source reference for correlation with fMRI, PET, and structural MRI data of the living human brain.

The basal forebrain comprises heterogeneous structures
located close to the medial and ventral surfaces of the cerebral
hemispheres. The most prominent feature of the primate
basal forebrain is the presence of continuous collection of
aggregated and non-aggregated, large, hyperchromic neurons,
often referred to as the “magnocellular basal forebrain
system” (Hedreen et al., 1984). Compact cell clusters, especially those underneath the posterior limb of the anterior
commissure and subpallidal (sublenticular) areas, are called
the basal nucleus of Meynert. Large neurons in this area are
continuous with similar cells in the medial septum and in the
nuclei of the diagonal band and with scattered large cells in
association with various fiber bundles, including the internal
capsule and anterior commissure. A substantial proportion of
the magnocellular neurons in primates represent cholinergic

corticopetal projection neurons (Mesulam et al., 1983; Saper
and Chelimsky, 1984; Mesulam and Geula, 1988) that have
received particular attention due to their loss in Alzheimer’s
and related disorders (Perry et al., 1984; Price et al., 1986).
Cholinergic neurons in rodents are intermingled with
GABAergic, and glutamatergic corticopetal neurons and
various peptidergic interneurons (reviewed in Zaborszky and
Duque, 2003; Hur and Zaborszky, 2005).
The term basal nucleus of Meynert[1] has been used in the
past as a synonym with the substantia innominata (“Ungenante Mark-Substanze”, Reil, 1809), especially in the clinical
literature. This latter term, however, lost its significance in the
light of recent tracer and histochemical studies indicating that
the main part of the basal forebrain that was previously called
the substantia innominata belongs to nearby and better
defined anatomical systems. The rostral, subcommissural

the substantia innominata, when describing the various compartments of the
magnocellular neurons, we will use topographical terms and well known fiducial
markers.

part of the substantia innominata is mainly occupied by the
ventral extensions of the striatum and globus pallidus, i.e. the
ventral pallidum and the core/shell subdivisions of the nucleus
accumbens (ventral striatum). More caudally, the sublenticular
part of the substantia innominata is occupied by the “extended
amygdala”, which refers to the subpallidal cell bridges
extending from the centromedial amygdala to the bed nucleus
of the stria terminalis (Heimer et al., 1985, 1991; Zaborszky
et al., 1985; Sakamoto et al., 1999; Heimer et al., 1999; Heimer,
2000; Riedel et al., 2002; de Olmos, 2004; Heimer and van
Hoesen, 2006).
Electrophysiological studies in rodents lend support to the
notion that basal forebrain cholinergic and GABAergic neurons
are important modulators of cortical activation (reviewed in
Detari, 2000; Zaborszky and Duque, 2003; Lee et al., 2005).
Furthermore, a substantial amount of experimental data in
animals, including primates, suggest the involvement of the
basal forebrain in attention, learning, memory, reward and
cortical plasticity (Wilson and Rolls, 1990; Richardson and
DeLong, 1991; Voytko et al., 1994; Chiba et al., 1995; Everitt
and Robbins, 1997; Wang et al., 1997; Gaffan et al., 2002; Muir
et al.,1994; Conner et al., 2005; Turchi et al., 2005; Sarter et al.,
2006; McGaughy et al., 2002; Weinberger 2007). Similarly,
imaging studies in humans – as detailed below – lend support
for a role of the basal forebrain in a range of cognitive
functions. Table 1 lists some of the imaging studies that
reported coordinates with reference to the Talairach system
(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988).

Paus et al. (1997) investigated the time course of changes in
brain activity during a continuous performance auditory
vigilance task. As the level of vigilance is shifted from high
alert to drowsiness, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF)
decreased in the fronto-parietal network and in several
subcortical structures, including the substantia innominata,
medial thalamus, and ponto-mesencephalic tegmentum.
These changes were interpreted by Paus et al. (1997) as
coordinated functions of a separate cortical–subcortical
arousal system and a cortical auditory attention network. In
the study of Morris et al. (1998), conditioning-related,
frequency-specific modulation of tonotopic responses in the
auditory cortex of young male volunteers was studied. The
modulated regions of the auditory cortex co-varied positively


with activity in the basal forebrain, amygdala, and orbitofrontal cortex. Furthermore, in an aversive conditioning
paradigm, Morris et al. (1997) manipulated the salience of
visual stimuli and found that augmented activation of the
right pulvinar co-varied with a region of the basal forebrain.
It has been long known that basal forebrain lesions in
humans, including those from trauma, tumor, or rupture of
the anterior cerebral or anterior communicating arteries
result in impaired memory functions (Damasio et al., 1985;
Morris et al.,1992; Diamond et al.,1997; Abe et al.,1998). Since
multiple anatomic regions were often damaged in these cases,
it has been difficult to determine the exact area of the lesion
that caused the cognitive symptoms. A recent fMRI study in
young male volunteers suggested that activity in the nucleus
of the diagonal band of Broca and the subcallosal area is
related to episodic memory recall (Fujii et al., 2002). In
another study, using delayed match to sample paradigm
sensitive for working memory, activations were found in the
dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and basal forebrain regions
(Swartz et al., 1995).
Cocaine infusion into cocaine-dependent volunteers leads
to significant fMRI signal changes in a basal forebrain region
that is populated by cholinergic cells (Breiter and Rosen,
1999). However, the same region has been claimed as part
of the “sublenticular extended amygdala”, a continuum
between the centromedial amygdala and the bed nucleus of
the stria terminalis (Heimer and Van Hoesen, 2006). It
remains an open question whether or not activations related
to the basal forebrain corticopetal system can be segregated
from those cell groups that belong to the extended
amygdala system.
Finally, consistent with the state-dependent changes of
unit recordings in rodents across sleep stages (e.g., Lee et al.,
2005), basal forebrain areas in humans were among those that
showed significant changes in glucose metabolism (rCMRglu)
or rCBF throughout the sleep–wake cycle (Braun et al., 1997;
Maquet et al., 1997; Nofzinger et al., 2002).
Due to the complex anatomy of the basal forebrain, the
contribution of a specific anatomical system to a particular
cognitive function has not been well understood. The superimposition of postmortem anatomical and in vivo functional
data into the same reference space allows correlations

between cerebral microstructure and functional imaging data
(Rolland and Zilles, 1994; Amunts et al., 2002; Zilles et al.,
2002; Amunts et al., 2004). A microstructural map of the basal
forebrain region, however, is not available. Therefore, the goal
of the present study was to provide cytoarchitectonic
probabilistic 3D maps of basal forebrain structures that
contain cholinergic projection neurons. Since cholinergic
neurons are often aggregated in clusters and constitute most
of the large neurons (N 20 μm long axis) in this brain area
(Mesulam et al., 1983), the areas containing such magnocellular cell groups within the septum, the horizontal and vertical
limbs of the diagonal band, and in the sublenticular basal
forebrain can be easily delineated in histological sections
stained with a modified Gallyas’s silver method for cell bodies
(Merker, 1983). This method has been proven as an excellent
marker for cytoarchitectonic studies (Uylings et al., 1999;
Zilles et al., 2002). The cytoarchitectonic maps of ten human
brains were warped to the reference space of the Montreal
Neurological Institute (MNI) single subject brain (Collins et al.,
1994; Holmes et al., 1998). The resulting probabilistic maps
can now be correlated with functional neuroimaging data for a
better understanding of the role of various basal forebrain
systems in cognitive functions.

Materials and methods

Fixation, MRI and histological processing

Brains from five males and five females with no record of
neurological or psychiatric diseases were obtained at autopsy
(Table 2). All subjects were included in the body donor
program of the Institute of Anatomy at the University of
Duesseldorf (Germany). The mean age of the subjects was:
64.9 years (range 37–75 years, Table 2). Seven brains were
fixed in 4% formaldehyde for several months; three brains
were fixed in Bodian-fixative. The brains were suspended at
the basilar artery to avoid compression during fixation. T1weighted MRI scans were obtained using a 1.5 T Siemens
Magnetron SP scanner (3D FLASH pulse sequence; flip
angle=40°; TR=40 ms; TE=5 ms; voxel size=1.17 mm

[mediolateral]×1 mm [rostrocaudal]×1 mm [dorsoventral])
for documentation of brain size and shape before subsequent
histological processing, which induces shrinkage and distor

tion. The brains were dehydrated in graded alcohols,
embedded in paraffin, and sectioned coronally (20 μm whole
brain sections). Images of the paraffin block-faces were
obtained after each 15th section. Each 15th section was
mounted on a gelatin-coated slide and stained for cell bodies
with a modified silver method of Gallyas (Merker, 1983). This
staining yields high contrast of cell bodies for cytoarchitectonic analysis and delineation of regions of interest. Each
stained section was digitized using a flat bed scanner.

Delineation of basal forebrain areas in the histological sections,
spatial normalization and generation of probabilistic maps

The outlines of various basal forebrain compartments were
traced on 2D images of the sections (1.2 mm apart) with a final
resolution of 7000×6000 pixels using in-house software. The
outlines were processed as contour line for each histological
section. For delineation of the magnocellular basal forebrain
compartments we used a modified version of the Ch1–Ch4
nomenclature of Mesulam (Mesulam et al., 1983), as detailed
in the Results section. Magnocellular neurons in the basal
forebrain often constitute cell aggregates or clusters that
facilitate their recognition. As a rule, borders of delineated
areas were drawn where the number of large cells precipitously diminished toward surrounding regions (e.g. Fig. 5B).
The histological sections of the postmortem brains were
reconstructed in 3D (“histological volume”) from the digitized
histological sections using the MRI scans of the fixed brain as a
shape reference with a resolution of 1 mm isotropic. A major
difficulty of the reconstruction results from inevitable distortions of the histological sections, which occur during cutting
and mounting on glass carriers: These distortions were
modelled by the reconstruction algorithm, to arrange the
histological sections correctly within the MR volume of the
fixed brain (Schormann and Zilles 1998; Hoemke, 2006).
Each 3D reconstructed histological volume was spatially
normalized to the single subject T1-weighted MNI reference
brain (Collins et al., 1994; Holmes et al., 1998) using a
combination of affine linear and non-linear, elastic transformations (Henn et al.,1997; Hoemke, 2006). The MNI reference
space is frequently used in functional imaging studies, e.g. in
[the software environment of SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
[uk/spm/). The origin of this reference space is not aligned to](http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/spm)
the intersection of the AC-PC line with the interhemispheric
plane as in the Talairach stereotaxic space (Talairach and
Tournoux 1988; T-T). To obtain a stereotaxic space with the
origin of the anterior commissure at the level of the
interhemispheric plane, the present data were shifted in Y
and Z plane by 4 and 5 mm, respectively (“anatomical MNI

in the T-T space, but in the anatomical MNI space.
Finally, based on the whole 3D brain reconstructions,
volume and shape of the magnocellular cell groups were
computed. We applied therefore the transformations, which
have been calculated for the 3D-reconstruction of the whole
histological sections, for the contour lines. Since the spatial
resolution of the digitized histological sections (and the
contour lines) was larger than that of the MR data set of the
postmortem brain (reference for 3D-reconstruction), we
decreased the resolution of the contours accordingly. In the
next step, a stack of filled contour lines was generated, which
was visualized by surface rendering techniques (marching
cube approach). In this study, the software Amira[®] (Mercury
Computer Systems[®], Chelmsford, USA) was applied for this
purpose.
Probability maps were calculated separately for each Ch
compartment. Based on the sample of ten brains, they
describe the relative frequency with which the same basal
forebrain area (e.g., Ch1–2; Ch3, Ch4, or Ch4p) was repre

sented in each voxel of the reference space as shown in Fig. 8
for Ch1–2, Fig. 9 for Ch3, Fig. 10 for Ch4, and Fig. 11 for the
posterior part of Ch4 compartment. Fig. 12 shows the
probability maps of the Ch space in the reference brain
without subdividing into several compartments. The center of
gravity for each Ch compartments was then calculated (Table
3). For a spatial comparison of the Ch cell groups with the
surrounding BF structures, including the ventral pallidum,
nucleus accumbens and the bed nucleus of the stria
terminalis, all structures were combined in one data set by
assigning labels to each voxel. A voxel was assigned to a
structure that had the highest probability or that exceeded a
threshold of 40% (Fig. 13). The generation of these maximum
probability maps (MPM) is described elsewhere (Eickhoff et
al., 2005, 2006). Histograms were calculated for quantifying
the volume of overlap of the individual structures (Fig. 14).
Since the absolute volume of overlap is larger in large nuclei
and smaller in small nuclei, we normalized the histograms by
the sum of voxels to make the histograms comparable for all
nuclei (see Supplementary Table 1 for the original data). Fig.16
shows the 3D rendering of an individual brain using the
software Amira[®].

Volume measurements

The volumes of the individual Ch compartments (Table 4)
were calculated using Cavalieri’s principle as previously
described (Amunts et al., 2005). Volumes of Ch1–2, Ch3, Ch4
and Ch4p were analyzed statistically with respect to left–right
and sex differences (ANOVA with repeated-measures design;
within factors: area, and hemisphere; between factor: sex). A

Results

Diagonal band of Broca and basal nucleus of Meynert in
histological sections

Fig. 1 shows the position of all magnocellular compartments as delineated in this study from a male brain #1696 at
six coronal levels. Figs. 2–7 illustrate the cytoarchitecture of
the delineated areas as traced from high resolution images of
the same sections shown in Fig. 1.

Ch1–Ch2 compartment (Figs. 1A, 2A, B)
Magnocellular neurons at the level of the area subcallosa
and gyrus rectus stretching from just below the fused midline
of the septum to the ventral edge of the brain and extend close
to the medial border of the nucleus accumbens. This
compartment largely corresponds to the medial septal
nucleus and the nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca as
defined by Andy and Stephan (1968). In the more dorsal part
of this area, corresponding to the Ch1 group of Mesulam et al.
(1983), the cell bodies and initial dendrites of the neurons
tend to be oriented perpendicularly to the crossing fibers of
the anterior commissure in coronal sections. The ventral part
of this compartment (Ch2 group of Mesulam) merges laterally
with the Ch3 cell groups. No distinction was made between
Ch1 and Ch2 groups.

Ch3 group (Figs. 1B, 3A, B)
The Ch3 group of the present account corresponds to the
horizontal nucleus of the diagonal band of Broca as defined by
Hedreen et al., (1984), labeled by DB in Halliday et al. (1993)
and Saper (2004) and labeled with DBB in Swaab (2003). The
Ch3 compartment can be regarded as linking cell groups in the
medial septum-vertical diagonal band nucleus (Ch1–2) with
the more elaborate magnocellular cell groups in the sublenticular forebrain (Ch4). Fig. 3A is taken at the level where
the fibers of the anterior commissure reached the opposite
side through the midline, to show the characteristic position
of the Ch3 group. The cells in this compartment (Fig. 3B) tend
to be oriented in all directions and are somewhat looser
arranged than the more laterally located, often fusiform cells
of the Ch4 cell groups (compare Fig. 3B with Fig. 4B).

Ch4 group (Figs. 1C–E, 3A, 4–6)
Cell aggregates in the subpallidal region, largely correspond to the basal nucleus of Meynert as defined by Vogels
et al. (1990) and De Lacalle et al. (1991). We did not differentiate subcomponents of the Ch4 compartment as
suggested by Mesulam et al. (1983). The large neurons in
the Ch4 compartment extend as far rostrally as cell

ventrolateral edge of the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis
at the border of the internal capsule/anterior commissure
were also classified as Ch4 (Fig. 3A). Fig. 4A, taken at the
rostral level of the supraoptic nucleus where darkly stained
cells of the Ch4 group are present in the area ventral to the
internal part of the globus pallidus, stretching between the
lateral hypothalamus and the temporal aspect of the anterior


commissure, some large neurons are in close relation to the
anterior commissure. Neurons often build cell clusters and
their nuclei are oriented more or less parallel to the brain
surface (Fig. 4B). Fig. 5A is taken slightly more caudally, at
the level of the anterior hypothalamic area. The delineated
area contains scattered large neurons, in addition to cell

clusters of various sizes. Fig. 6 is from a more caudal level,
showing small clusters of Ch4 neurons ventral to the globus
pallidus and medial and dorsal to the temporal limb of the
anterior commissure. Some of these cell groups are arranged
around the ansa peduncularis.

Ch4 posterior group (Figs. 1F, 7)
We retained the term Ch4p for magnocellular cell groups in
a well-defined area that begins caudal to the supraoptic
nucleus at the level where the optic tract adjoins the internal
capsule/cerebral peduncle and extends progressively laterally
up to the most caudal level of the medial mammillary nucleus
and the central nucleus of the amygdala. Fig. 7B is an enlarged
view of the medial, triangular cell aggregate of Ch4p from Fig.
7A, which is located underneath the internal component of
the globus pallidus. At the level of the subthalamic nucleus, a
few large, darkly stained cells invade the medial aspect of the
putamen, the lateral part of the globus pallidus, and the area
above the central amygdaloid nucleus (not shown). These
small cell clusters also belong to Ch4p.

Probabilistic maps

The probabilistic maps of Figs. 8–11 show the interindividual microstructural variability for each delineated Ch
compartment using a color code: blue colour shows that
only one brain is represented in an actual voxel, while red
color indicates that all ten brains are overlapping. Those parts


of the Ch 1–2 that have the lowest inter-subject variability
(i.e., highest overlap of individual brain structures) are located
rostrally and immediately adjoining the crossing fibers of the
anterior commissure (y =3 to y =0). Approximately 28% of the
voxels in the Ch1–2 region in the reference brain represent
overlap of five or more brains (Fig. 8).

Fig. 9 shows the probabilistic map of the Ch3 cell groups,
which are located more posterior than the Ch1–2 compartment. It reveals a slightly higher intersubject variability than
Ch1–2. Most of the voxels representing a high overlap of Ch3
cells are found between levels y =0 and y = −3. Approximately
24% of all voxels in Ch3 represent an overlap of five or more
brains.
The probabilistic maps of the Ch4 region show a relatively
large overlap at y = −6 (Fig. 10). However, a few voxels with
high overlap stretch rostrally in front of the decussating fibers
of the anterior commissure (between y =0 and y = − 3).
Approximately 28% of all voxels in the Ch4 region in the
reference brain represent an overlap of five or more brains.
The Ch4p region shows the highest inter-subject variability
among the delineated structures, accordingly only few red
voxels can be seen in Fig. 11. This compartment occupies the
most caudal position among the magnocellular basal forebrain
structures. On the average, 19% of all voxels in the Ch4p of the
reference space overlap in five or more brains.

Fig. 12 displays probabilistic maps at 6 coronal levels when
all Ch groups are considered without subdividing into
compartments. Since neighboring Ch compartments overlap


-----

at their borders, these maps show many more red voxels that
originate from all ten brains than the previous probabilistic
maps of the individual compartments. Fig. 13 shows the
maximum probability maps (MPM) of the various Ch regions.
Each voxel was assigned to the cytoarchitectonic area that
showed the greatest overlap (“winner take all”) among the ten
examined post-mortem brains. As a result, MPMs show a nonoverlapping representation of the Ch compartments in the
anatomical MNI space.

Fig. 14 shows the normalized distributions of overlapping
voxels of the individual Ch regions in the anatomical MNI
space. The comparison of the frequency distributions of these
basal forebrain structures clearly demonstrates a similar
degree of intersubject variability across Ch compartments
(see for original data Supplementary Table 1).

largest volume while the Ch3 constituted the smallest one.
Interhemispheric and sex related differences in volume were
not significant (p N 0.05). There was, however, a significant age

design and Bonferroni correction (Fig. 15).

3D Rendering

the spatial distribution of cell clusters in more detail. Although
the full configuration can be appreciated only when rotating
the model in a coordinate system with surrounding structures,
it is obvious even from these panels, showing various aspects
of the model, that the entire magnocellular system occupies a
complicated space, extending from medially in the septum to
caudo-laterally toward the amygdaloid body. Within this
space, magnocellular neurons of the Ch4 compartment form
several bands (clusters) of various size and shape that are in
part parallel and in part connected with each other. The cell
aggregates of the Ch3, and especially Ch1–2 have a simpler

it becomes obvious that the various cell aggregates of the Ch4
compartment penetrate the nucleus accumbens, ventral
pallidum, and the bed nucleus of the stria terminalis to
some extent.

Discussion

In the present study, we manually delineated the
magnocellular cell aggregates of the human basal forebrain
in silver-stained sections in order to generate cytoarchitechtonic probabilistic maps in stereotaxic space. Most of the
neurons of the extended amygdala are small or mediumsized and occupy a different position than the cholinergic
neurons in the subcommissural/subpallidal territory in
primates (Ghashghaei and Barbas, 2001). Since most of the
cholinergic neurons are larger than cells in the surrounding
areas, and 90% of the magnocellular perikarya in the Ch4
compartment are cholinergic (Mesulam et al., 1983), the
space identified based upon the presence of large neurons in
high-resolution histological sections, is likely represent the
cholinergic space; i.e., the volume occupied by the cortically

projecting cholinergic cell bodies. Mapping from ten brains
resulted in probabilistic maps with high overlap, comparable
to other subcortical nuclei (e.g., amygdala; Amunts et al.,
2005). The resulting probabilistic maps can be correlated
with future functional neuroimaging data for a better understanding of the role of various basal forebrain systems in
cognitive functions.


Organization of the human magnocellular basal forebrain
system

The widely dispersed, more or less continuous collection of
aggregated and non-aggregated large neurons that extend
obliquely from the septum rostrally to the level of the lateral
geniculate body caudally is often called the “magnocellular
basal nucleus” (Saper and Chelimsky, 1984;De Lacalle and
Saper, 1997), or “magnocellular basal forebrain system”
(Hedreen et al., 1984). The rostral portion of these neurons is
associated with the medial septum and the nucleus of the
diagonal band of Broca, and primarily project to the
hippocampus. On the other hand, neurons located more
caudally in the subcommissural and sublenticular space, often
referred to as the basal nucleus of Meynert, project topographically to various cortical areas (Jones et al., 1976;
Mesulam et al., 1983; Pearson et al., 1983). The topographical
organization of corticopetal cholinergic projection in humans
has been confirmed in cases of Alzheimer’s disease that had
relatively selective cell loss in various sectors of the basal
forebrain. From these cases one can conclude that medial
frontal and cingulate cortices are innervated from more
medial cell groups, whereas the lateral neocortex, including
the prefrontal, temporal, parietal and occipital cortices receive
their projections from more lateral subdivisions of the
magnocellular system (Arendt et al., 1985; Mesulam and
Geula, 1988).

Mesulam et al. (1983) proposed a Ch nomenclature to
differentiate cholinergic neurons according to their cortical
target areas. According to this scheme the entire Ch4 space is
subdivided into 6 compartments termed anteromedial
(Ch4am), anterolateral (Ch4al), anterointermediate (Ch4ai),
intermediodorsal (Ch4id), intermedioventral (Ch4ai) and
posterior (Ch4p). However, the original subdivisions in
standardized MRI space were only partly applied in the
present study because we did not apply specific staining for
cholinergic neurons. Moreover, in many instances it is not
possible to consistently define boundaries between individual
compartments, as noted already in 1988 in a symposium on
nomenclature of the basal forebrain cholinergic system
(Butcher and Semba, 1989). For example, the boundaries
between Ch1 and Ch2 seem to be arbitrary and these two
regions were taken together in our study, similar to the
delineations used by Vogels et al. (1990). The Ch3 group,
according to the original description of Mesulam et al. (1983),
refers to a band of fusiform neurons close to the ventral
surface of the brain in the subcommissural area (see for
example, Figs. 7A and 10A in Mesulam and Geula,1988; Fig. 3A

Note that voxel representing maximum overlap are located between levels y =0 and y = − 3.

in Mufson et al., 1988). The cell group designated as Ch3 in our
paper represents a transitory area between the septumdiagonal band complex and the more caudal cell groups of the
magnocellular basal forebrain system and may correspond to
be part of the anteromedial Ch4 group in some publications
(Mesulam et al., 1983; Lehericy et al. 1993; Gilmor et al., 1999).
We, and others, noted that a separation of the anterior Ch4
group into medial and lateral sectors by a vascular structure,
as proposed by Mesulam and his coworkers, is ambiguous due
to the variation of the vessels (Halliday et al., 1993; Swaab,
2003). Similarly, delineations of other Ch4 subdivisions are


difficult to reproduce due to lack of specific landmarks, except
for a well-defined posterior subgroup behind the supraoptic
nucleus where the optic tract attaches to the internal capsule/
cerebral peduncle. Our Ch4p probably corresponds to the
nucleus subputaminalis of Ayala (Ayala, 1915; Simic et al.,
1999). Hyperchromic, large neurons can often be found
underneath the nucleus accumbens, and around the borders
of the posterior limb of the anterior commissure along the
putaminal border or more caudally within the ventral putamen itself. We incorporated these cell groups into the Ch4
group, since these cells seem to be connected to the bulk of
Ch4 cell aggregates in 3D renderings.
The inhomogeneous, dense clusters of neurons in the
magnocellular basal complex are interrupted by regions of
low cellular density in humans (Halliday et al.,1993) as well as
in rodents and monkeys (Zaborszky et al., 1999). The heterogeneous distribution of cholinergic cells and the highly
variable shape of the cholinergic space across the rostrocaudal
extent of the basal forebrain may have contributed to differing
renderings of the magnocellular basal forebrain complex in
primates, including humans (see Pearson et al.,1983; Mesulam
et al., 1986; Ulfig, 1989). A publication of a preliminary
computer-assisted 3D reconstruction of the magnocellular
cells from gallocyanin-stained human sections by Heinsen and
his colleagues (2006) showed a similar configuration as
depicted in Fig. 16 of the present paper. Moreover, the
magnocellular space in humans as shown in Fig. 16 in this
study is remarkably similar in its architecture to the cholinergic space in computerized 3D reconstructions of rodents
(Zaborszky et al., 1999; Nadasdy and Zaborszky, 2000;
Zaborszky et al., 2005).

Intersubject variability in standard reference space

Obstacles to a more thorough examination of basal forebrain
structures in imaging studies of the living human brain include
the low intensity and interdigitating nature of the different
anatomical systems. In addition, variations in the size of the
ventricles and the exact angle of brain orientation may affect the
assessment of ventral areas in MRI. In an attempt to overcome
these problems, Buchsbaum et al. (1998) took advantage of the
thin-plate spline warping technique, developed by Bookstein
(1990) using geometrical landmarking, including the anterior
commissure, the internal capsule, and the fornix that are easily
identifiable in MRI scans. However, because the positions of the
magnocellular cell groups differ across brain sections, a 2D
warping method seriously limits the conclusions that can be
reached using this method for evaluating the magnocellular

compartments. Note that these maps show many more red voxels than previous maps

basal forebrain complex. Moreover, some structures like the
ventral border of nucleus accumbens have indistinct margins
that are difficult to trace on MRI images.
The method employed here overcomes these problems. The
magnocellular cell groups are identified in high resolution
histological sections with an appropriate staining. The 3D
reconstruction of the histological sections allows for the transfer
of delineated structural information into 3D MRI space. The
spatial normalization of the postmortem brains to the common
reference space, which consists of several steps, enables to study
differences between the architecture of the individual brains
and the reference brain. The affine linear transformations
reduce global differences in scaling (size), rotation (orientation),
translation (position), and shearing. The subsequent non-linear
transformations were pixel/voxelwise transformations that
account for local differences in brain shape. The modeling of
the MR data sets of each brain as an elastic medium ensures that
the non-linear transformations were smooth. Hence, the
topology of the brain regions was preserved.
Variability in the probabilistic maps is, therefore, mainly an
indicator for interindividual structural variability on a microscopic level rather than gross brain morphology. Normalizing
the overlapping voxels to the total volume of a particular Ch
compartments suggests that the intersubject variability of the
four Ch regions is similar (Fig.14). Intersubject variability can be
expressed in various ways, for example, we can compare the


percentage of voxels in the probability maps that represent
more than five brains (see Supplementary Table 1). Taken all of
Ch compartments together (volume for one hemisphere in MNI
space: 4785 mm[3]), the Ch volume that originates from five or
more brains is 37% of the total. This percentage value is
compatible to that of the amygdala (44%; Amunts et al., 2005).
Itexceeds that for the previously studied neocortical area 44 and
area 45 of Broca’s regions (11% and 18%, respectively; Amunts et
al., 1999). Another example of a neocortical area is sensory area
3b, which is represented in the anatomical MNI space by a
volume of 107,514 mm[3], however; only 16% of this space is
devoted to overlapping voxels originating from five or more
brains (Eickhoff et al., 2005). Due to relatively high overlap (i.e.,
low interindividual variability) of subcortical structures, as
compared to some neocortical areas, probability maps should be
efficient tools for the precise topographical analysis of structural
changes in the basal forebrain in aging and Alzheimer’s disease.

Age and disease-related changes in the magnocellular basal
complex

Severe involvement of the magnocellular basal complex has
been found in Alzheimer’s disease, where various studies
reported cell loss up to 90% (Whitehouse et al., 1981; Vogels et
al., 1990; Lehericy et al., 1993; Cullen and Halliday, 1998).
Estimations of the neuronal loss of basal nucleus of Meynert
during normal aging also vary greatly from 23% to 50% to no
neuronal loss at all (Whitehouse et al., 1981; Chui et al., 1984;

Fig. 14. Frequency distribution of the various Ch4 cell groups showing the relation of
overlapping volumes in the anatomical MNI space. In order to make the distributions of
the various Ch compartments with different volumes comparable for all nuclei, we
normalized the histograms by the sum of voxels (for original data see Supplementary
Table 1). Upper histogram displays the individual Ch compartments, lower histogram
show the total left and right Ch space only. For example, the total volume of right Ch3
compartment is represented in the MNI space by 856 mm[3], from this volume 424 voxels
(424 mm[3]) originates from single brains, thus occupying 49.5% of the total space
dedicated to Ch3; 105 voxels originate from 2 brains (12.3%) and 51 voxels from seven
brains (5.9%). For easier orientation, these percentage values are marked by arrows in
the upper diagram. The lower diagram shows only the distribution of voxels from the
total left and right Ch compartments, respectively. For example, the total volume of the
right Ch space in the MNI reference brain is represented by 4855 voxels (4855 mm[3]),
from this volume 166 mm[3] represent overlapping space from 10 brains, while
1549 mm[3] devoted to Ch space originating from single brains (for more details see
Supplementary Table 1).

De Lacalle et al.,1991). In addition to Alzheimer’s disease, there
are structural changes in the basal forebrain occasionally in
Parkinson’s disease, Rett syndrome, progressive supranuclear


palsy, Parkinson dementia complex of Guam, dementia
pugilistica, Pick’s disease, Korsakoff’s syndrome, Down syndrome, Wernicke’s encephalopathy, and Cretuzfeldt–Jacob
disease (reviewed in Swaab, 2003). However, much controversy remains whether or not the neuropathological changes
are primary or secondary, what is the time course of changes,
and whether or not the neuropathological changes occur in the
entire extent of the cholinergic space or are restricted to its
specific regions. Some of the unresolved issues are at least
partly due to the fact that neuropathological examinations are
restricted to postmortem cases from a single time point of
advanced stages of the disease.
In vivo measures of morphological changes in the basal
forebrain would be of great importance for a better understanding of how structural changes correlate to cognitive
symptoms in Alzheimer’s disease. These measures are difficult
to obtain since smaller subdivisions of the basal forebrain
cannot be distinguished in vivo in routine MRI, but at a
microscopic resolution. An alternative to an identification of
microstructural nuclei in the individual brain, geometrical
landmarks have often defined volumes of interest of the
magnocellular basal forebrain cell groups. For example, agerelated gray matter loss in the basal forebrain was reported in a
voxel-based MRI study (Ishii et al., 2005). However, it is not clear
from this study to what extent shrinkage of other brain areas
contributed to the result. In two another studies, Sasaki et al.
(1995) and Hanyu et al. (2002) measured the thickness of an
area below the anterior commissure in coronal MR images in
patients with Alzheimer’s disease and elderly controls. They
found a significant correlation between age and thickness of the
measured values in control subjects, in agreement with the agedependent decrease of the volume of Ch4 in our study. However,
methodological problems may have influenced the results of
this study. For example, a signal loss in the globus pallidus,
caused by its magnetic susceptibility effect with the T2weighted spin-echo sequence (Schenker et al., 1993), may
limit the dorsal delineation of the ROI. Furthermore, in linear
measurements the angle of the section plane affects the
thickness of the tissue. In another study, Teipel et al. (2005)
defined an ROI about 20 times larger than the Ch4 area in our
study that included the anterior commissure, large parts of the
ventral globus pallidus and a small part part of the medioventral
putamen in addition to Ch4 of present account. Teipel et al.
(2005) found a signal decrease in proton density MRI in this ROI
in patients with Alzheimer’s disease compared with healthy

subjects. The degree of signal decline was related to the degree
of grey matter atrophy in cortical areas. However, taking into
consideration that many neighboring structures of the magnocellular space were included, the measurements based on such
large ROIs may lead to erroneous conclusions. Future research is
needed to validate these findings.

Concluding remarks

Probabilistic maps of the magnocellular cell groups in
standardized stereotaxic space can provide the fine-grained
parcellation necessary to localize neuropathological changes in
a heterogeneous regionsuch as the basal forebrain. The ability to
delineate precisely microstructural details together with the
improved sensitivity of advanced MRI, and with neuropsychological battery for memory disorders should allow the identification of patients with mild cognitive impairment, a patient
population who will convert to Alzheimer’s disease, but in
which early intervention may slow the disease progress.
Probabilistic maps from neighboring basal forebrain areas,
including the ventral pallidum, nucleus accumbens, and the bed
nucleus of the stria terminalis, will soon be available (Voss,
Amunts, Zilles and Zaborszky, in preparation). Using an
anatomical toolbox integrated in the SPM program the superimposition of postmortem anatomical and in vivo functional
data in the same space of a reference brain allows correlations to
be made between microstructural details and functional
imaging data (Eickhoff et al., 2005). The anatomical volume of
interest can be defined by using the maximum probability maps


or thresholding of individual probabilistic maps (e.g., N 50%).
Calculating the intersection between a volume of activation and
anatomically defined volume, hypotheses can be tested and the
structural substrates of functional activations can be inferred in
a probabilistic context (Eickhoff et al., 2006). For example, it has
been hypothesized, based upon anatomical data, that specific
clusters of projection neurons in the basal forebrain together
with specific prefrontal and posterior cortical associational
regions constitute distributed elements of functional parallel
circuits (Zaborszky, 2002). The close connectional relationship
betweenprefrontal and basal forebrain regions in rodents and in
primates are well known (Sesack et al., 1989>; Ghashghaei and
Barbas, 2001; Golmayo et al., 2003; Spiga and Zaborszky, 2006),
and imaging and neurophysiogical studies have found neural
correlates of both top–down [task-driven] and bottom-up

[stimulus-driven] attention processes in frontal and posterior
parietal cortices (Buschman and Miller, 2007). However, it is not
known whether or not the cholinergic system is activated as
part of a general arousal system or if spatially specific
cholinergic and other basal forebrain compartments would be
