Abstract The human extrastriate visual cortex comprises
numerous functionally defined areas, which are not identified in the widely used cytoarchitectonical map of Brodmann. The ventral part of the extrastriate cortex is
particularly devoted to the identification of visual objects,
faces and word forms. We analyzed the region immediately
antero-lateral to hOc4v in serially sectioned (20 lm) and
cell body-stained human brains using a quantitative
observer-independent cytoarchitectonical approach to further identify the anatomical organization of the extrastriate
cortex. Two novel cytoarchitectonical areas, FG1 and FG2,
were identified on the posterior fusiform gyrus. The results
of ten postmortem brains were then registered to their MRI
volumes (acquired before histological processing), 3D
reconstructed, and spatially normalized to the Montreal

Neurological Institute reference brain. Finally, probabilistic maps were generated for each cytoarchitectonical area
by superimposing the areas of the individual brains in the
reference space. Comparison with recent functional imaging studies yielded that both areas are located within the
object-related visual cortex. FG1 fills the gap between the
retinotopically mapped area VO-1 and a posterior fusiform
face patch. FG2 is probably the correlate of this face patch.

Introduction

The human visual cortex can be divided into the primary
visual or striate cortex (V1 or BA17) (Brodmann 1909) and
the adjoining extrastriate cortex. The extrastriate cortex
covers the largest part of the occipital lobe and extends into
the posterior parietal and temporal regions. Here, two
processing pathways have been described, the dorsal
pathway or ‘‘where’’-stream for spatial localization and
visually guided action, and the ventral pathway or ‘‘what’’stream, which is involved in object, color and shape recognition (Mishkin and Ungerleider 1982; Ungerleider and
Haxby 1994; Eickhoff et al. 2008). During the last decades,
a high degree of functional heterogeneity within the ventral
visual cortex has been revealed by functional imaging,
giving evidence for several functionally specialized areas,
e.g. the fusiform face area (FFA, Kanwisher et al. 1997;
Grill-Spector et al. 2004; Kanwisher and Yovel 2006;
Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010), the parahippocampal
place area (PPA, Epstein et al. 1999; Epstein 2008), the

visual word-form area (VWFA, Cohen et al. 2000; Wandell
et al. 2012) or the extrastriate body area (EBA, Downing
et al. 2001; Peelen and Downing 2005; Weiner and GrillSpector 2011b). Combined functional and cytoarchitectonical studies of extrastriate areas co-registered in the
same reference space are rare (Wohlschla¨ger et al. 2005;
Wilms et al. 2010).
Conventionally, four criteria have been used to distinguish the visual areas: (1) retinotopy, (2) functional properties, (3) histology and (4) intracortical connections (Clarke
and Miklossy 1990; Felleman and van Essen 1991; Sereno
et al. 1995; Zilles and Clarke 1997; Tootell et al. 2003;
Kolster et al. 2010). The classical anatomical maps from the
beginning of the last century (Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Sarkisov et al. 1949) have several
disadvantages when attempting to establish functional–
structural relationships: Most classical anatomical maps
only show a principal tripartition of the visual cortex with V1
(BA17/OC), V2 (BA18/OB) followed by a single large area
(BA19/OA) (Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas
1925) (Fig. 1). Functionally and also histologically, however, it becomes evident that BA19/OA comprises a variety
of functional and cytoarchitectonical areas within its ventral
and dorsal parts (Zeki 1969; van Essen 1979; Braak 1980;
Tootell et al. 1996; Zilles and Clarke 1997; Orban et al. 2004;
Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy et al. 2007). Moreover, all
classical anatomical maps are reported as schematic 2D hand
drawings of the cortical surface, which rarely provide

information about cortical areas within the sulci and contain
no information about stereotaxic location or interindividual
variability of cortical areas. Finally, these maps are established on the basis of subjective criteria for the definition of
cortical borders.
These shortcomings have prompted the development of
probabilistic cytoarchitectonical maps (Amunts and Zilles
2001; Zilles et al. 2002; Zilles and Amunts 2010). The
maps are based on the observer independent, statistically
testable analysis of postmortem brains (Schleicher et al.
2005, 2009), and contain information about stereotaxic
position and intersubject variability of cortical areas in the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) reference space
(Evans et al. 1992). The maps help to probabilistically
identify the cytoarchitectonical correlate of neuroimaging
activations seen in functional MRI, positron emission
tomography (PET), magneto- and electroencephalography
(MEG/EEG) using standard analyses packages (Eickhoff
et al. 2005; Zilles and Amunts 2010). As part of this atlasing project, probabilistic maps of the visual cortex have
already been defined for the primary visual area hOc1
(BA17) (Amunts et al. 2000), for secondary hOc2 (BA18)
(Amunts et al. 2000), and for tertiary hOc3v, hOc4v
(Rottschy et al. 2007) and hOc5 (Malikovic et al. 2007).
Since cytoarchitectonical maps of the ventral visual
areas anterior to hOc4v are presently not available, the aim
of our study was to investigate the structural organization
of this region on the posterior fusiform gyrus.

Materials and methods

Histological processing

Ten human postmortem brains (Amunts et al. 2000), five
males and five females (Table 1), were obtained from the
body donor program of the Institute of Anatomy, University of Du¨sseldorf. One brain came from a subject with
transitory motor disturbance (brain 3), all other donors had
no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases. Handedness of the subjects was unknown. We may assume that
most of the subjects were right-handed supposing a prevalence of left-handedness of \10 % in the general population (Annett 1973). The brains were removed from the
skulls within 8–24 h after death and fixated in 4 % formalin or Bodian’s fixative for at least 6 months. To document brain size and shape before the inevitable distortions
by histological processing occurred, each brain was scanned using a T1 weighted 3D-FLASH sequence (flip angle
40�, TR = 40 ms, TE = 5 ms) implemented on a Siemens
1.5T scanner (Erlangen, Germany). Subsequently, the
complete brains were embedded in paraffin and serially cut
into coronal sections of 20 lm thickness. Every 15th section was mounted on glass slides and silver stained for cell
bodies (Merker 1983) to achieve a high contrast between
darkly stained neuronal perikarya and unstained neuropil.
Every fourth stained section, i.e. every 60th section of the
series of sections, was examined, resulting in a distance of
1.2 mm between the analyzed sections (Fig. 2).

Detection of cortical borders

Cytoarchitectonical analysis was performed using a quantitative method for observer independent and statistically
testable detection of cortical borders (Zilles et al. 2002;

traced outer and inner cortical contours and curvilinear trajectories
along the cortical ribbon. Red numbers and trajectories indicate the
position along the cortical ribbon

Schleicher et al. 2005, 2009). First, rectangular regions of
interest covering the posterior fusiform gyrus and neighboring cortex were defined in the histological sections and
digitized using a microscope with a scanning stage
(KS400; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) and a CCD camera
(Sony, Tokyo, Japan; resolution 1.01 9 1.01 lm[2]/pixel)
(Fig. 2b). The digitized sections were then transformed
into gray level index (GLI) images, in which pixel values
represent the volume fraction of cell bodies in the corresponding square measuring fields of 20 9 20 lm[2] each
(Schleicher et al. 2000, 2005). If the GLI amounts to 20 %,
for example, 80 % of the volume in a measuring field are
occupied by neuropil (dendrites, axons, processes of glial
cells and blood vessels).
Equidistant GLI profiles were extracted along curvilinear trajectories oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers
and running from an interactively defined outer contour
between layer I and layer II to an inner contour between
layer VI and the white matter (Fig. 2c). These profiles
represent the course of the regional cell density from
superficial (outer contour) to deep (inner contour). To
compensate for variations in cortical thickness, we
resampled each profile with linear interpolation to a standard length corresponding to a cortical thickness of 100 %.
The shape of each GLI profile was quantified by a vector
consisting of ten features based on central moments, which

## 1 3

were also used for previous cytoarchitectonical studies
(e.g. Amunts et al. 2000; Amunts and Zilles 2001; Zilles
et al. 2002). These features were: the mean GLI value, the
position of the center of gravity on the profile curve (cortical depth), the standard deviation of the mean GLI
(indicating the variability of the GLI throughout all layers),
skewness and kurtosis of the profile curve and the
respective features from the profile’s first derivative
(Schleicher et al. 1999).
Differences in shape between GLI profiles indicate differences in cytoarchitecture and were quantified as the
Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis et al. 1949; Bartels
1979) between the respective feature vectors of neighboring blocks of profiles (Schleicher et al. 2005) at every
position along the cortical ribbon (Fig. 3). To assure reliability, the procedure is repeated for different block sizes
ranging from 8 to 24 profiles per block. Areal borders are
expected at positions where the distance function shows
local maxima corresponding to a great dissimilarity in
laminar pattern between adjacent blocks of profiles. These
maxima were detected and their significance evaluated by
the Hotelling’s T[2] test with Bonferroni correction for
multiple comparisons (Fig. 3b). Cortical borders were
confirmed, if they were consistently present at the same
position across several block sizes, and if the positions
were found at comparable sites in adjacent sections.

Computation of probabilistic cytoarchitectonical maps

3D reconstructions of the histological volumes were computed using the following three datasets: (i) the previously
ascertained 3D-MRI scan, (ii) images of the paraffin block
face obtained during sectioning for the precise alignment of
the histological sections and (iii) the digitized images of
the cell body-stained sections (Amunts et al. 2004).
The defined borders of the cortical areas were interactively traced on the corresponding sections of the 3Dreconstructed brains. The histological volumes were then
spatially normalized by registration to the stereotaxic space
of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) (Evans et al.
1992) using a combination of affine transformations and
nonlinear elastic registration (Ho¨mke 2006). To keep the
anterior commissure as the origin of the coordinate system
and for consistency with previous cytoarchitectonical
studies (e.g. Amunts et al. 2005; Rottschy et al. 2007;
Caspers et al. 2008; Scheperjans et al. 2008; Kurth et al.
2010), data were shifted by 4 mm caudally (y-axis) and
5 mm dorsally (z-axis) to the ‘anatomical MNI-space’
(Amunts et al. 2005). Corresponding areas of the ten brains
were superimposed and a probabilistic map was generated
for each area (Zilles et al. 2002). These maps indicate for

each voxel of the reference brain the relative frequency
with which a respective area was found at that position
(Eickhoff et al. 2007; Zilles and Amunts 2010).
The probability maps of all areas in the ventral visual
cortex were visualized as a continuous, non-overlapping
map of this region by generating a maximum probability
map (MPM). The MPM was computed by comparing the
probabilities of all areas in each single voxel and by
assigning to each voxel the cytoarchitectonical area with
the highest probability (Eickhoff et al. 2005, 2006). If two
or more areas showed equal probabilities in a single voxel,
this voxel was assigned to the area with the highest average
probability of the directly adjacent voxels.

Analysis of volumes

The volumes of the cytoarchitectonical areas were calculated for each hemisphere separately based on area measurements in the individual histological sections, section
thickness and distance between the measured sections as
well as the shrinkage factor of each brain. Shrinkage factors were determined as the ratio between the fresh volumes of the brains and their volumes after histological
processing (Amunts et al. 2005). The volumetric data were
then analyzed for interindividual and interhemispheric
differences using a repeated measurement analysis of variance (ANOVA) with the following design: between-subject factor: gender; within-subject factors: area and side;
blocking factor: subject.

Results

Two cytoarchitectonically distinct areas, FG1 and FG2,
were identified antero-lateral to hOc4v (Rottschy et al.

2007) on the posterior fusiform gyrus (Fig. 4). The term
‘‘FG’’ was used for ‘‘fusiform gyrus’’. This allows a neutral, macroanatomical nomenclature. The different areas of
the fusiform gyrus were labeled by numbers instead of
more descriptive labels like ‘‘medial’’ or ‘‘lateral’’. This
avoids future inconsistencies, as the total number of cytoarchitectonical fusiform areas and their relative spatial
arrangement are not yet known. Since the cytoarchitectonical areas described here were not previously identified,
any assignment to areas of Brodmann (1909) or von Economo and Koskinas (1925) was not meaningful. Asterisks
behind the names of two other areas (col.s.* and l.ot.s.*)
indicate that these areas were not completely mapped in the
present observation.
The more medial area FG1 was located immediately
lateral to the rostral portion of area hOc4v. It was found on
the medial half of the posterior part of the fusiform gyrus
and extended on the lateral bank of the collateral sulcus.
FG2 was located lateral to FG1 on the lateral half of the
fusiform gyrus and on the lateral occipitotemporal sulcus.
Rarely, minor parts of FG2 reached onto the inferior
temporal gyrus. FG2 extended more rostrally than FG1.
The rostral part of FG2 covered nearly the full width of the
fusiform gyrus.

Cytoarchitecture

Both areas belong to the homotypical isocortex with an
inner granular layer IV but with further distinctive cytoarchitectonical features:
FG1 was characterized mainly by a marked columnar
arrangement of small pyramidal cells and a lower cell
density in layer IV (Fig. 5) when compared to neighboring
areas. Layer II showed a rather low density of cells and
smooth transition into a layer III of low to moderate cell

density. The sizes of pyramidal cells in layer III were small
with no superficial to deep increase. These pyramidal cells
were arranged in clearly visible cell columns, a feature that
was unique to FG1 compared to the adjacent areas. Layer
IV of FG1 was thin, but clearly delineable from adjacent
layers IIIc and V. Pyramidal cells in layer V were small
and showed a columnar arrangement as well. The cell
sparse layer VI had no conspicuous border with lower layer
V. The border between cortex and white matter was
blurred.
FG2 showed large pyramidal cells in lower layer III and
a prominent layer IV as characteristic features (Fig. 5). A
columnar arrangement of pyramidal cells was not found,
neither in layer III nor in layer V. Layer II of FG2 had a
rather high cell density with a clearly delineable border to

the cell sparse layer IIIa. Large, typical pyramidal cells of
layer III were primarily found in sublayers IIIb and IIIc
with a slight increase of cell sizes in deep sublayer IIIc.
This sublayer often merged with the broad and cell dense
layer IV. Layer V consisted of equally distributed pyramidal cells, which were smaller than those in lower layer
III but larger than those of FG1. Layer V was clearly delineable from the cell dense layer VI, which again had a
distinct border to the white matter.
To demonstrate the variability of these cytoarchitectonical features of FG1 and FG2 along the rostro-caudal
extent, Fig. 6 illustrates three representative sections of a
single brain. The intersubject variability of cytoarchitectonical features is illustrated by sections of three different
brains (Fig. 7). Figures 6 and 7 highlight that the main
characteristic features of each area, e.g. visible or not
visible columnar arrangement of pyramidal cells, prominent or inconspicuous subdivisions of layer III, and width
and cell density in layer IV, could be found as distincitive
features at all sectioning levels and in all brains studied.
FG1 and FG2 differed not only by their cytoarchitecture
(Fig. 8a) but could also be separated from adjoining cortical areas (see Table 2 for an overview):

slices. For each area, segments of three consecutive sections from one
single hemisphere (brain 8 left) are shown. Numbers above images

subjects. For each area, segments of sections from three different
brains are shown. Brain number is indicated above the images. An ‘R’
or ‘L’ below indicates the hemisphere (right or left) and the following
number labels the section number. Roman numerals indicate cortical
layers

Posteriorly, FG1 immediately adjoined hOc4v, which
was characterized by a more cell dense layer II with a welldefined border to layer III (Fig. 8b). This latter layer
showed larger pyramidal cells with a characteristic superficial to deep increase of cell sizes and no clear arrangement in cell columns. Layer IV provided the most
pronounced distinction as it was prominent and had a
higher cell density in hOc4v when compared to FG1. Cells
in layer V were also larger in hOc4v but not densely
packed. Layer VI of hOc4v again showed a higher cell
density and a better defined border to the white matter.
In the more rostral parts, FG1 was followed medially by
a new, not further analyzed area col.s.*, which was found
anterior to hOc4v (Fig. 8c). col.s.* showed medium-sized
and densely packed pyramidal cells in layer III, particularly
in sublayer IIIc, with no columnar arrangement. Layer IV
of col.s.* was more cell dense and slightly thicker than that


of FG1, layer V showed a higher cell density, and layer VI
had a distinct border to the white matter.
The likewise not yet completely mapped area l.ot.s.*
was found lateral to FG2. Area l.ot.s.* extended into the
lateral occipitotemporal sulcus and on the inferior occiptal
and inferior temporal gyrus. l.ot.s.* showed cell sparse
sublayers IIIa and IIIb with large pyramidal cells only in
lower IIIc (Fig. 8d). Layer IV of this area, was less
prominent than in FG2 and difficult to delineate from layer
III. The cell density of layer V in l.ot.s.* was lower than in
FG2, and the border between layer V and layer VI was
blurred.

Volumes and stereotaxic location

The statistical analysis of the histological volumes of FG1
and FG2 (Table 3) revealed a significant size difference
between both areas (F = 25.547, p = 0.01) in favor of
FG2. There were no significant effects of the factors side
(F = 2.990, p = 0.122), gender (F = 1.784, p = 0.218)
and no significant effects of the interactions between
area and side (F = 0.011, p = 0.920), between area and
gender (F = 0.254, p = 0.628), between side and gender
(F = 0.380, p = 0.555) and between area, side and gender
(F = 0.001, p = 0.981).
The coordinates for the centers of gravity of areas FG1
and FG2 in anatomical MNI space are given in Table 4. A
slight difference of the anterior–posterior location was
noted as both areas were located more rostrally in the right
hemisphere. This interhemispheric shift has already been
reported for other striate and extrastriate areas in previous
studies (Amunts et al. 2000; Rottschy et al. 2007), and
reflects the marked asymmetry in position of the occipital
poles in the MNI single-subject template.

Probability map and maximum probability map

Probability maps (PMaps) were generated for each FG area
by superimposing the spatially normalized representations
of the individual subjects (Fig. 9). The PMaps reflect the
probability of observing the respective area in single voxels
of the MNI space in our sample of postmortem brains. The
probability maps for FG1 and FG2 barely showed regions
with high probabilities for one area (overlap of 9 or 10
brains), but broad regions with low probabilities (overlap
of 1 or 2 brains) in the periphery of each of the FG areas.
This reflects a high intersubject variability of both areas,
which is much higher compared to early visual areas hOc1
and hOc2 (Amunts et al. 2000).
Consequently, there was substantial overlap between the
probabilistic maps of FG1 and FG2 and also adjoining area
hOc4v. To assign the most likely area to each single voxel,
an MPM of the visual cortex (comprising areas hOc1,

(Fig. 10). The MPM represents a contiguous, non-overlapping parcellation of this region. It hence bears a close
conceptual resemblance to presentations in classical brain
maps. Importantly, however, the MPM does not show the

parceling of an exemplary or ‘‘typical’’ hemisphere as do
previous architectonic brain maps (Brodmann 1909; von
Economo and Koskinas 1925), but reflects the most likely
area based on a sample of ten brains and represented in
each voxel of the reference space.

Discussion

This study reports the microscopical features and stereotaxic locations of two previously unknown cytoarchitectonical areas, FG1 and FG2, of the ventral human visual


cortex. Our mapping study used quantitative, statistically
testable cytoarchitectonical criteria (Schleicher et al. 2005),
to overcome uncertainties caused by pure visual inspection
(Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas 1925;
Sarkisov et al. 1949) and intersubject variability.
FG1 is located on the medial half of the posterior fusiform gyrus and extends rostrally on the lateral bank of the
collateral sulcus. FG2 is located lateral to FG1 on the lateral half of the fusiform gyrus reaching into the lateral
occipitotemporal sulcus.
An interpretation of the cytoarchitectonical areas
described here should be based on a comparison with
previously proposed cytoarchitectonical maps and results
of recent functional imaging research. It should be noted,
however, that a simple comparison of center of gravity
coordinates is problematic because of tremendous divergences between the coordinates in the different functional
imaging reports [e.g. Bartels and Zeki (2004) report the
center of the FFA at L: [-44, -46, -24]/R: [44, -46,
-26], while Spiridon et al. (2006) report L: [-50.1, -69.2,
-7.5]/R: [31.3, -55.8, -5.9], both labeled ‘‘Talairach
space’’). The divergences may be caused by the usage of
different reference spaces, since the terms ‘‘MNI space’’ or
‘‘Talairach space’’ are not sufficiently clear definitions in
many studies. Thus, the stereotaxic coordinates of the same
cortical site can vary considerably between the different
studies even if the same definition, e.g. ‘‘MNI space’’ was
used, depending on the precise position of the CA-CP-line
(CA = commissura anterior, CP = commissura posterior)
and other aspects as shown in detail by Lancaster et al.
(2007). Due to this remarkable lack of comparability
between studies using seemingly identical reference space,
the purely coordinate-based correlation between cytoarchitectonical and functional imaging data coming from
different studies is problematic, particularly if positions of
cortical areas have to be compared. In this case, minimal
differences in the position of the CA-CP-line lead to rather
large deviations in location of the rather remote cortical
areas. Therefore, a comparison of stereotaxic coordinates

Comparison with previous architectonic maps

Classical anatomical maps of the human brain show a tripartition of the visual cortex (Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Sarkisov et al. 1949). Brodmann
(1909) mentioned that his temporal area BA37, which

## 1 3


color coded (see color bar). Stereotaxic coordinates of the illustrated
sections in anatomical MNI space are denoted in the top left corners
of each map

adjoins BA19 in its ventral parts, is a transitional area
between temporal and occipital regions. Von Economo and
Koskinas (1925) found a roughly comparable area to BA37
adjoining their area OA, which can be seen as an equivalent
to BA19. They describe the cytoarchitecture of this
adjoining area as highly heterogeneous but were not able to
delimit clearly defined subregions of this area. Because
they saw primarily cytoarchitectonical characteristics of
the parietal lobe, they assigned this area to the parietal
region and labeled it ‘‘area parietalis temporooccipitalis’’
or PH. Whereas the classical architectonical definitions of
the primary and secondary visual cortex (BA17 and BA18)
are fully agreed by most observers (Amunts et al. 2000), it
became evident by functional neuroimaging and nonhuman primate data that BA19/OA should be subdivided
into multiple functionally and putatively also architectonically distinct regions (Zeki 1969; van Essen 1979; Braak
1980; Tootell et al. 1996). It seems conceivable that FG1
and FG2 are situated within the border region between
BA19 and BA37 or OA and PH, respectively.
Detailed maps of the occipital and adjacent temporoparietal lobe were published by Braak (1977) in his pigmentoarchitectonical study. His report included drawings
of identified areas on the cortical surface as well as coronal
sections, which makes a comparison less difficult. FG1 and
FG2 topographically fit to Braak’s (1977) ‘‘area peristriata
densopyramidalis’’. Its description as a ‘‘well-developed
bitaeniate cortex with conspicuous pIIIc’’ (‘‘bitaeniate’’ = ‘‘double-striped’’) is likewise in accordance with
our observations on the cytoarchitecture of area FG2.
Braak (1977), however, identified a single area in this

region. Our results indicate clear cytoarchitectonical differences between two areas and hence a sub-parcellation of
‘‘area peristriata densopyramidalis’’ into FG1 and FG2.

Comparison with functional imaging data

Retinotopy is a common organizational principle of early
visual areas in the primate visual cortex (e.g. Sereno et al.
1995; DeYoe et al. 1996; Engel et al. 1997). Utilizing this
principle, retinotopic mapping has emerged to the gold
standard in functional imaging of these early visual areas
and yielded robust results for the borders of areas V1,
V2 and V3v (Tootell et al. 1998; Wade et al. 2002;
Wohlschla¨ger et al. 2005).
However, there has been an intense debate during the
last decade concerning the anterior border of human area
V4. One view proposed an area V4v, representing the
(contralateral) upper-quarterfield, followed anteriorly by a
color-selective area, containing a complete hemifield representation termed V8 (Hadjikhani et al. 1998; Tootell and
Hadjikhani 2001). This arrangement was challenged by
others, who postulated V3v to be the most anterior quarterfield representation, which is then followed by a hemifield representation selective for color perception. They
labeled this area the V4-complex, containing V4 and an
anterior non-retinotopic subarea V4a. The authors did not
see any evidence for a quarterfield representation like in
V4v (Bartels and Zeki 1998, 2000; Zeki 2001). A third
scheme contained an upper field representation, analogous
to V4v, followed anteriorly by its matching lower field
termed human V4 (hV4). The authors argued for yet
another color-selective hemifield representation, VO-1
anterior to it (Wade et al. 2002; Wandell et al. 2005;
Brewer et al. 2005).
It should be mentioned that the hV4/VO-1 model does not
contradict the V4-complex model, but can be harmonized
with it, while the V8 model cannot (Wade et al. 2002).
Furthermore, the hV4/VO-1 model was later confirmed by
other laboratories (Kastner et al. 2001; Larsson et al. 2006;
Arcaro et al. 2009; Kolster et al. 2010). Our study shows two
distinct cytoarchitectonical areas FG1 and FG2 antero-lateral to the cytoarchitectonical area hOc4v (Rottschy et al.
2007), which overlaps with retinotopically defined hV4
(Wilms et al. 2010). The descriptions of VO-1 as an area in
the collateral sulcus and on the medial fusiform gyrus
(Brewer et al. 2005; Liu and Wandell 2005) would topographically fit to FG1. However, the apparently closer
proximity of VO-1 to the collateral sulcus and its location
directly anterior to hV4 as well as the reported coordinates
(Kastner et al. 2001; Brewer et al. 2005; Liu and Wandell
2005; Arcaro et al. 2009) suggest that VO-1 is more medial
than FG1 and probably correlates with the medially adjoining cytoarchitectonical area col.s.* (Fig. 8c).


Recently, another retinotopic region has been discovered lateral to hV4, i.e. the phPIT cluster (Kolster et al.
2010), which refers to macaque areas PITd and PITv on the
posterior inferotemporal gyrus (Felleman and van Essen
1991). The phPIT cluster is located on the inferior temporal
gyrus at the posterior end of the lateral occipitotemporal
sulcus and consists of two hemifield representations,
phPITd and phPITv, which share their foveal representation and vertical meridians. The lateral of our identified
cytoarchitectonical areas, FG2, is located on the lateral
bank of the posterior fusiform gyrus and within the posterior lateral occipitotemporal sulcus. FG2 rarely reaches
the inferior temporal gyrus. Thus, the topography and the
center of gravity coordinates indicate that phPIT is located
posterior and dorsal to FG2, and most probably overlaps
with the laterally adjoining cortex (Fig. 8d).
Taken together, the comparison with current retinotopic
literature indicates that FG1 and FG2 do not correspond to
any hitherto identified retinotopic area. Instead, both cytoarchitectonical areas seem to fill in the ‘‘non-retinotopic
gap’’ that is spanned between VO-1 medially and phPITv
laterally (see Kolster et al. 2010, Fig. 16A). A minor
peripheral overlap between these retinotopic and our cytoarchitectonical areas cannot be completely ruled out. However, such a mismatch between cytoarchitectonically and
retinotopically defined cortical units would be in contrast to
the correlation of both parcellation approaches in other
cortical areas, e.g. in V1 and V2 (Wohlschla¨ger et al. 2005).

Besides its retinotopic organization, the human ventral
visual cortex contains a number of apparently categoryspecific functional modules for visual object processing.
Some regions that respond more strongly to visual objects
than to scrambled images were identified around the posterior fusiform gyrus and the inferior occipital gyrus. They
are called the ‘‘lateral occipital complex’’ (LOC, Malach
et al. 1995, 2002; Kanwisher et al. 1996; Grill-Spector
et al. 2001). Bilateral LOC-activations receive input from
both hemifields (Grill-Spector et al. 1998) and are correlated with recognition performance of objects (GrillSpector et al. 2000). Conventionally, the LOC comprises
two entities, the dorsal ‘‘LO’’ and the ventral and anterior
‘‘pFs’’ on the posterior and mid-fusiform gyrus, which
differ in their response to size and position changes of
presented objects (Grill-Spector et al. 1999). A later
scheme assigned pFs to an object-selective cluster ‘‘VOT’’
of the ventral occipitotemporal cortex directly adjoining
early retinotopic visual areas (Malach et al. 2002). In
consideration of the pertinent reports of the LOC, a direct
correspondence of our areas FG1 and FG2 to a LOC-cluster
seems to be unlikely, as they are located between both
classical clusters, ventral to LO and posterior to pFs.
Indeed, the center of gravity of FG2 is in close proximity to

## 1 3


-----

the coordinates of the ‘‘branching point’’ between both
LOC-clusters described by Malach et al. (1995). Thus, an
overlap of the margins of LOC with FG2 is possible. Based
on the VOT-scheme predicting object-responsive areas
directly adjacent to early visual areas (Malach et al. 2002),
it can be hypothesized that FG1 and FG2 are both situated
within the higher order object-related cortex.
Additional to the LOC and partially overlapping with it,
some areas selective for specific objects have been identified within the ventral occipitotemporal cortex including
the prototypical example of the ‘‘fusiform face area’’
(FFA). First hints on the existence of the FFA were derived
from studies on subjects with prosopagnosia. These subjects showed a bilateral or right-hemispheric lesion in the
ventral occipitotemporal cortex (Damasio et al. 1982; De
Renzi 1986; Landis et al. 1986; Sergent and Signoret
1992). Later PET studies revealed a distinct activation on
the fusiform gyrus during face perception tasks in healthy
volunteers (Sergent et al. 1992; Haxby et al. 1994). The
face specificity and location of the FFA could be demonstrated at higher spatial resolution in numerous fMRI
studies (Clark et al. 1996; Puce et al. 1996; Kanwisher
et al. 1997; Tong et al. 1998; Halgren et al. 1999; Hasson
et al. 2001; Grill-Spector et al. 2004; Kanwisher and Yovel
2006). In addition, a response to images of headless bodies
was reported on the fusiform gyrus in the vicinity of the
FFA (Cox et al. 2004; Peelen and Downing 2005). High
resolution fMRI identified this activation as adjacent yet
distinct from the FFA in the fusiform body area (FBA,
Schwarzlose et al. 2005). Most functional investigations
locate the FFA on the lateral bank of the posterior or midfusiform gyrus, about 1–2 cm anterior to the here identified
cytoarchitectonical area FG2 (e.g. Gauthier et al. 2000;
Hasson et al. 2001; Levy et al. 2001; Avidan et al. 2003;
Rossion et al. 2003; Grill-Spector et al. 2004; Bartels and
Zeki 2004; Peelen and Downing 2005). However, some
reports show peak activations much closer to FG2 (Puce
et al. 1996; Kanwisher et al. 1997; Halgren et al. 1999;
Ishai et al. 1999). This discrepancy might be explained by a
recent investigation of the fusiform gyrus demonstrating a
subdivision of the FFA into a posterior and an anterior part
(Weiner and Grill-Spector 2010, 2011a), which was also
suggested by others (Pinsk et al. 2009; Mei et al. 2010).
The posterior face patch named pFus-faces accurately
matches the location of our lateral cytoarchitectonical area
FG2 situated on the lateral bank of the posterior fusiform
gyrus antero-lateral to hV4 and, hence, might be its functional correlate.
Another functional, category-specific area, which is
located within the lateral occipitotemporal sulcus extending onto the lateral fusiform gyrus is the visual word-form
area (VWFA), which responds specifically to words and
letter strings. First hints came from patients suffering from

## 1 3


lesions in the ventral occipitotemporal cortex and respective neuropsychological deficits, i.e. pure alexia (Damasio
and Damasio 1983; Binder and Mohr 1992). This functionally defined area could later be localized by PET
(Petersen et al. 1990; Petersen and Fiez 1993), MEG
(Tarkiainen et al. 1999) and fMRI (Wagner et al. 1998;
Cohen et al. 2000; Hasson et al. 2002; Dehaene et al.
2002), although the functional specificity of VWFA was
also controversially discussed (Price and Devlin 2003).
Similar to our area FG2, the VWFA was first described to
be located on the lateral fusiform gyrus (Cohen et al. 2000;
Dehaene et al. 2002), but more recent findings show that
the large portion of VWFA lies within the fundus of the
lateral occipitotemporal sulcus and about 1 cm anterior to
FG2 (Cohen and Dehaene 2004; Baker et al. 2007; BenShachar et al. 2007; Wandell et al. 2012). An overlap of
FG2 with language-related visual areas is possible, since
FG2 largely extends into the lateral occipitotemporal sulcus and distances of FG2 to the center of gravity of VWFA
are quite small (e.g. Cohen et al. 2002; Vigneau et al. 2005;
Dehaene et al. 2010; Mei et al. 2010). Moreover, the processing of words seems to continuously extend from early
visual areas to the ventral occipitotemporal locations in a
hierarchical manner (Dehaene et al. 2005; Szwed et al.
2011), where FG2 could possibly be involved at an intermediate stage.
Our results indicate that FG1 and FG2 are symmetrically
found in all ten brains, showing the same cytoarchitectonical features on both sides and no significant left–right
differences in volume. By contrast, the majority of reports
show a right lateralization of the FFA that apparently
depends on handedness (Willems et al. 2010), while the
VWFA is most often left lateralized (e.g. Cohen and Dehaene 2004). This does not exclude a possible overlap of the
functional and our cytoarchitectonical areas, since different
functional manifestations can be implemented on the same
cytoarchitectonical basis. Furthermore, recent investigations imply that lateralization for faces (Weiner and GrillSpector 2010) and words (Ben-Shachar et al. 2007) is
possibly much less pronounced as hitherto assumed.
Thus, our cytoarchitectonical areas FG1 and FG2
probably lie within the object-related higher order visual
cortex on the posterior fusiform gyrus. Furthermore, FG2
likely comprises a posterior fusiform face-selective patch.
However, distinct functional correlates in this region are
rare. This issue might also be affected by the fMRI artifacts
evoked by the transverse sinus, a venous vessel, which
commonly proceeds directly inferior to the cortex we
investigated here (Winawer et al. 2010). Appropriately,
Winawer et al. (2010) denote this region as ‘No man’s
land’. A more specific-functional characterization of FG1
and FG2 and the relation to object, face and visual word
processing remains a topic for future work. It can certainly


-----

be encouraged by further improved functional imaging
techniques and comprehensive approaches including cytoarchitectonical, retinotopic and category-related investigations. For now, we provide probability maps that can be
used to relate functional measurements to our cytoarchitectonical delineations and, hence, can help to understand
the functional role of this region rostrally adjoining the
early ventral visual cortex.

Conclusions

The present study detected two novel, cytoarchitectonically
distinct areas on the human posterior fusiform gyrus, using
a quantitative microscopical approach. The delineation of
the extrastriate areas is used to provide probabilistic maps
in standardized 3D-stereotaxic space. The maps allow a
comparison of functional imaging data on object, face and
word-form recognition with its putative cytoarchitectonical
correlates. Comparisons between our map and previous
functional imaging studies suggest that FG1 and FG2 are
situated in a not yet retinotopically mapped gap between
VO-1 and phPITv whereas FG2 is the cytoarchitectonical
correlate of the posterior face patch pFus-faces.
