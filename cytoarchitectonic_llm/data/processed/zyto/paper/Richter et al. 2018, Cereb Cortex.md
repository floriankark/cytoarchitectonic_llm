### Abstract

##### Human posterior intraparietal sulcus (pIPS) and adjacent posterior wall of parieto-occipital sulcus (POS) are functionally diverse, serving higher motor, visual and cognitive functions. Its microstructural basis, though, is still largely unknown. A similar or even more pronounced architectonical complexity, as described in monkeys, could be assumed. We cytoarchitectonically mapped the pIPS/POS in 10 human postmortem brains using an observer-independent, quantitative parcellation. 3D-probability maps were generated within MNI reference space and used for functional decoding and meta- analytic coactivation modeling based on the BrainMap database to decode the general structural–functional organization of the areas. Seven cytoarchitectonically distinct areas were identified: five within human pIPS, three on its lateral (hIP4-6) and two on its medial wall (hIP7-8); and two (hPO1, hOc6) in POS. Mediocaudal areas (hIP7, hPO1) were predominantly involved in visual processing, whereas laterorostral areas (hIP4-6, 8) were associated with higher cognitive functions, e.g. counting. This shift was mirrored by systematic changes in connectivity, from temporo-occipital to premotor and prefrontal cortex, and in cytoarchitecture, from prominent Layer IIIc pyramidal cells to homogeneous neuronal distribution. This architectonical mosaic within human pIPS/POS represents a structural basis of its functional and connectional heterogeneity. The new 3D- maps of the areas enable dedicated assessments of structure–function relationships.

### Introduction

The most prominent anatomical landmark of the human posterior parietal cortex (PPC) is the IPS. It subdivides the PPC into
superior (SPL) and inferior (IPL) parietal lobules, whereupon its
sulcal pattern varies considerably among individuals (Ono et al.
1990; Ebeling and Steinmetz 1995; Choi et al. 2006; Zlatkina and
Petrides 2014). At the parieto-occipital transition, the posterior
part of IPS (pIPS) approaches the POS, from which it is typically
separated by a gyral passage (Zlatkina and Petrides 2014). The
POS separates the PPC (anterior wall of POS) from the occipital
lobe (posterior wall of POS) and is typically a continuous sulcus
(Ono et al. 1990; Malikovic et al. 2012).
Focusing on the posterior part of IPS (pIPS) and adjacent
posterior wall of POS in humans, a differential functional
involvement in a variety of visuomotor and cognitive functions has been reported (for review, see e.g. Culham and
Kanwisher 2001; Binkofski et al. 2015). Among visuomotor
functions, human pIPS and posterior wall of POS are involved
in the control of arm and eye movements (Kertzman et al.
1997; Corbetta et al. 1998; Berman et al. 1999; Petit and Haxby
1999; Astafiev et al. 2003; Schluppeck et al. 2005; Konen and
Kastner 2008a; Konen et al. 2013). Furthermore, regions within
human pIPS and posterior wall of POS are activated by tasks
requiring attention (Corbetta et al. 1998; Coull and Frith 1998;
Corbetta and Shulman 2002; Silver et al. 2005; Schluppeck
et al. 2005, 2006; Uncapher et al. 2011; Rosen et al. 2015), and
working memory (Coull and Frith 1998; LaBar et al. 1999;
Pessoa et al. 2002; Offen et al. 2010; Barton and Brewer 2013;
Raabe et al. 2013; Bray et al. 2015). Human pIPS is additionally
involved in spatial cognition (Colby and Goldberg 1999; Husain
and Nachev 2007; Sack 2009), as well as processing of motion
(Culham et al. 1998; Shulman et al. 1999; Sunaert et al. 1999;
Konen and Kastner 2008a), shape of visual objects (Denys
et al. 2004; Xu 2008; Konen and Kastner 2008b; Durand et al.
2009; Bettencourt and Xu 2016), and numbers (Dehaene et al.
2003, 1998; Nieder 2005; Dehaene 2009).
Furthermore, several topographically-organized areas have
been identified along the anterior–posterior axis of the IPS,
defined using visuotopic mapping in memory-guided saccade
tasks (Silver et al. 2005; Swisher et al. 2007; Konen and Kastner
2008a; Silver and Kastner 2009). Here, pIPS showed higher connectivity to early and higher visual regions, anterior IPS had
stronger connections to prefrontal regions (Uddin et al. 2010;
Mars et al. 2011; Greenberg et al. 2012; Bray et al. 2013).
Such an enormous functional diversity raises the question
of its structural correlates. Evidence of a structure–function
relationship could be derived from studies in monkeys.
Microstructural, electrophysiological, and functional analyses
revealed a subdivision of monkey pIPS and posterior wall of
POS into several distinct areas, named after their topographical
position: e.g. lateral (LIP), posterior (PIP), and caudal (CIP) intraparietal area in the pIPS, as well as V6 and V6A in the the POS
(Seltzer and Pandya 1986, 1980; Colby et al. 1988; Andersen
et al. 1990; Felleman and van Essen 1991; Cavada et al. 2000;
Lewis and van Essen 2000; Galletti et al. 2003; Gamberini et al.
2015). Using single-unit recordings and functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) studies in alert monkeys, different
visuomotor functions could be associated with distinct microstructurally defined areas, with shifts of functional involvement along an anterior–posterior as well as a medio-lateral
axis with regard to visual perceptive, attentional, or sensorimotor functions (Culham and Kanwisher 2001; Orban et al. 2006,
2004; Grefkes and Fink 2005; Orban 2016).


##### Histological Processing and 3D-Reconstruction of Postmortem Brains

Ten human postmortem brains (five male, five female) were
cytoarchitectonically analyzed (Table 1). They were provided by
the body donor program of the Anatomical Institute of the
University of Düsseldorf, Germany, and comply with the
requirements of the local Ethics Committee. Except for one
brain with basal ganglia infarction, no other donor showed a
history of psychiatric or neurological diseases. After removing
the brains from the skull within the first 24 h postmortem, the
brains were fixed in 4% formalin or Bodian’s fixative for at least
6 months. Prior to histological processing, an MRI scan using a
T1-weighted structural 3D FLASH sequence (flip angle = 40°,
repetition time = 40 ms, echo time = 5 ms) on a 1.5-T Siemens
scanner (Erlangen, Germany) was obtained for each fixed brain,
serving as a reference undistorted by histological procedures
for subsequent 3D-reconstruction. Histological processing
included dehydrating in a rising alcohol series, embedding in
paraffin, serial cutting into coronal sections of 20 μm thickness
by using a large-scale microtome, mounting of every 15th


While there is ample evidence on distinct structure–function
relationships in monkey pIPS and POS, linking the functional
heterogeneity of human pIPS and adjacent posterior wall of POS
to its structural underpinnings could hardly be established until
now, as detailed anatomical maps were not available. Structural
atlases in humans (Fig. 1) comprising a parcellation of this brain
region are rare and often of limited use for direct comparison
with modern functional neuroimaging data (Zilles and Amunts
2010; Amunts and Zilles 2015). In the most widely used brain
map of Brodmann (1909; Fig. 1A), which still influences the present idea of the microstructural organization of the human cortex, both sulci were not further analyzed landmarks within the
PPC and adjacent occipital cortex. A cytoarchitectonic parcellation of human IPS based on a single hemisphere was proposed
by Gerhardt (1940), resulting in 15 areas around and within the
IPS (Fig. 1B). This observation still awaits independent confirmation, being one of the reasons why its impact for understanding
functional neuroimaging findings has been marginal.
Furthermore, the interindividual variability of the sulcal pattern
of IPS and POS was not accounted for in classical cytoarchitectonic maps either. Within the anterior part of the human IPS
(aIPS), three cytoarchitectonic areas were identified, using the
same observer-independent, quantitative mapping approach as
applied in the present study. Two areas were found on the lateral bank and adjacent bottom of aIPS (hIP1, hIP2; Choi et al.
2006), and one on the medial wall (hIP3; Scheperjans, Eickhoff
et al. 2008; Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008).
To find a respective microstructural basis for the functional
diversity of human pIPS and adjacent posterior wall of POS, the
cytoarchitecture of this region was mapped in the present
study using an observer-independent, statistically testable
quantitative mapping method. The resulting cytoarchitectonic
maps of human pIPS and posterior wall of POS consider interindividual variability and were registered in the widely used MNI
reference space, enabling a direct comparison with functional
imaging data. Using quantitative meta-analysis based on the
BrainMap database (Eickhoff et al. 2009, 2012), the cytoarchitectonically defined areas were used as seed regions to reveal
overall functional network integration of these areas as a starting point for future dedicated assessments on structure–function relationships in this region.

section on glass slides, and staining for cell bodies with a modified silver stain (Merker 1983). Every 60th histological section
was used for cytoarchitectonic analyses and digitized in a flatbed scanner. During the cutting process, blockface images were
obtained using a CCD camera (XC-75, Sony, Japan, image matrix =
256 × 256 pixels, 8 bit gray value resolution). Integrating the undistorted MR-images with the blockface and digitized images after
histological processing, the postmortem brains were 3Dreconstructed (Amunts et al. 2000).

##### Observer-Independent Detection of Cortical Borders


Based on observer-independent and statistically testable criteria, cytoarchitectonic areas were delineated (Schleicher et al.
2009, 1999). Briefly, a rectangular region of interest (ROI) was
defined in images of histological sections covering the pIPS
caudal to hIP1-3 and the adjacent posterior wall of POS


(Fig. 2A). The ROIs were scanned in a mosaic-like pattern with a
high-resolution CCD camera (AxioCam MRm, Zeiss, Germany)
attached to a computer-controlled microscope (Axio Observer.
Z1, Zeiss, Germany). Using in-house software implemented in
Matlab (The MathWorks, Inc., Natick, MA, USA), digitized ROIs
were converted into gray level index (GLI) images (Schleicher
et al. 1999). The GLI reflects the volume fraction of stained cell
bodies (Wree et al. 1982; Schleicher and Zilles 1990; Schleicher
et al. 1999) within a measuring field of 17 μm × 17 μm, ranging
from 0% (only neuropil) to 100% (only cell bodies). In each GLI
image, equidistant GLI profiles were extracted as traverses perpendicular to the cortical layers between interactively defined
outer (between layer I and II) and inner (between layer VI and
the white matter) contour lines (Fig. 2B; Schleicher et al. 1999,
2000, 2005). The GLI profiles along these traverses represented
laminar changes in volume density of cell bodies, thus reflecting cortical cytoarchitecture (Schleicher et al. 2009). Variations

profiles were extracted. (C) The Mahalanobis distance functions (ordinate) plotted against profile positions (abscissa) for a particular block size b. Significant maxima
of the Mahalanobis distance function refer to profile positions with potential borders between two cytoarchitectonically different cortical areas. In this example, the

Mahalanobis distance reaches significant local maxima at profile positions 79 and 158. (D) Profile positions (abscissa) of significant maxima of the Mahalanobis dis
tance functions (points) plotted for different block sizes (ordinate) b = 10 (bottom) to 24 (top). For most of the block sizes b, the Mahalanobis distance function reaches

significant maxima at or adjacent to profile positions 79 and 158, corresponding to the border between hIP4 and hIP7, and between hIP7 and hPO1, respectively.


in cortical thickness were compensated for by normalizing the
length of each profile to 100% (= normalized cortical thickness)
via linear interpolation. To characterize the GLI profile curve a
feature vector with ten elements was calculated, containing
five features (mean GLI value, mean of cortical depth, standard
deviation of the mean GLI, skewness, kurtosis) from the original GLI profile and the corresponding five features from its differential quotient (Schleicher et al. 1999). To increase signal-tonoise GLI profiles were summed up to blocks of 10–24 GLI profiles. Blocks for each block size were systematically moved
along the cortical ribbon using a sliding window technique. To
quantify differences in shape of mean GLI profiles between
neighboring blocks, the Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis
et al. 1949) was calculated as a measure for similarity or dissimilarity between the profiles. A significant maximum of the
Mahalanobis distance function indicated a cytoarchitectonical
border (Fig. 2C), and was tested for statistical significance using
a Hotelling’s T2 test (P < 0.01, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple
comparisons; Schleicher et al. 1999). A peak was accepted as a
cytoarchitectonical border between cortical areas, if the
Mahalanobis distance showed significant maxima for different
block sizes (b = 10–24) at comparable profile positions (Fig. 2D),
and if this border was found at comparable position along the
cortical ribbon in adjacent sections. Finally, each automatically
and observer-independently detected border was verified by
microscopic inspection of the sections to exclude detection of


“artificial borders” caused by, e.g. larger blood vessels, or wrinkles or other artifacts caused during mounting and staining of
the sections, which would lead to artificial distortions of profile
curves.

##### 3D Cytoarchitectonic Probability Maps in Stereotaxic Space


Delineations of all areas in pIPS and posterior wall of POS were
manually transferred onto corresponding digitized sections
using in-house software, and 3D-reconstructed in each postmortem brain. The brains and delineated areas were registered
to the T1-weighted single-subject template brain (Colin27;
Evans et al. 1992) of the standard reference space of the
Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) via combination of linear
affine and non-linear elastic transformations (Hömke 2006).
Data aligned to the Colin27 brain in original MNI space were
then shifted linearly by 4 mm in the y-axis and 5 mm in the
z-axis to the “anatomical MNI space”. This procedure resulted
in a shift of the origin of the coordinate system to the anterior
commissure (Amunts et al. 2005). Note that this is not equivalent to transforming data to the Talairach space as this requires
a non-linear transformation (e.g. Lacadie et al. 2008). By superimposing each identified region of all 10 brains in the MNI
single-subject brain (Colin27), 3D continuous probability maps
were generated for each area. These probability maps assigned


-----

each voxel of the reference brain the relative frequency with
which a cortical area was located at a particular position in the
reference space across all 10 postmortem brains, represented
in a continuous map (e.g. Lorenz et al. 2017). The probability
maps thus quantified interindividual anatomical variability of a
cortical area in the reference space, continuously ranging from
0 to 100%. This variability led to spatial overlap of neighboring
probability maps of pIPS and posterior wall of POS areas, which
prevented unambiguous assignment of each voxel to a particular area. Therefore, continuous non-overlapping maximum
probability maps (MPMs) were calculated by assigning each
voxel of the reference brain to the cortical area with the highest
probability in this voxel (Eickhoff et al. 2006). If two or more
areas show equally high probabilities at a specific voxel, this
voxel was assigned to the cortical area with the higher average
probability in the neighboring voxels.

##### Volumetry


and visualized as a hierarchical dendrogram. Areas with a high
degree of cytoarchitectonic similarities were merged to one
cluster, reflected by low Euclidean distance in between. The
more the value of Euclidean distance increased, the more dissimilar areas were in terms of their cytoarchitecture. A multidimensional scaling analysis was used to reduce data complexity
and visualize the degree of similarities or dissimilarities of
each pIPS and posterior wall of POS area in a 2D distance
matrix, together with the confidence intervals of 95%.

##### Quantitative Meta-Analysis


The volume of each identified area was calculated separately
for each hemisphere, based on area measurements in the digitized histological sections (for details, see Amunts et al. 2007).
The volume V [mm[3]] is a function of the distance s between
analyzed sections (i.e. every 60th section of the continuous
series of sections was analyzed, therefore s = 60 × 20 μm =
1.2 mm), the pixel size (Δx = Δy = 21.16 μm), the shrinkage factor (F) of each individual brain caused by the histological processing, and the number of pixels (N) of the cortical area in the
section number i:

##### V = s × Δx × Δy × F × ∑ Ni


For each brain, the individual shrinkage factor F was calculated as the ratio between its fresh volume and its volume after
histological processing (Amunts et al. 2007). The corrected
mean volumes of all areas were statistically analyzed for sex
and hemispheric differences, as well as the interaction between
hemispheric and gender differences by using pairwise permutation tests in Matlab (Bludau et al. 2014). For testing these differences against the null-hypothesis of side exchangeability,
each hemisphere was randomly reassigned to one of two possible groups (male/female and left/right, respectively), and the
differences between those randomly assembled groups were
calculated anew. This procedure was repeated a million times.
Sex or hemispheric differences were considered significant, if
they were larger than 95% of the values under the nullhypothesis (P < 0.05; False Discovery Rate corrected for multiple
comparisons).

##### Hierarchical Cluster Analysis and Analysis of Multidimensional Scaling of Cytoarchitectonic Features


Using Matlab, the degree of similarities or dissimilarities in
cytoarchitecture between pIPS and posterior wall of POS areas
was quantified by performing a hierarchical cluster and a multidimensional scaling analysis. For each area, a block of 15 GLI
profiles was selected in each of three selected sections without
apparent artifacts or oblique sectioned segments of the cortex.
From these 45 GLI profiles for each area in each hemisphere
and brain, mean GLI profiles and corresponding feature vectors
were computed, representing a quantification of the underlying
cytoarchitecture. In the hierarchical cluster analysis, the clustering of these feature vectors was performed using the
Euclidean distance and the Ward linkage method (Ward 1963)


[Using the online database BrainMap (http://brainmap.org; Fox](http://brainmap.org)
and Lancaster 2002; Laird et al. 2005), a quantitative coordinatebased meta-analysis was performed, comprising three parts:
(1) functional decoding of each area of pIPS and posterior wall
of POS for functional characterization, (2) functional connectivity
analyses by obtaining coactivation maps, and (3) conjunction
and contrast analyses to statistically test for commonalities and
differences in coactivation patterns. The aim of this analysis
was to reveal overall organizational principles of functional
involvement and brain network integration of the identified
areas in pIPS and posterior wall of POS based on a multitude of
different functional imaging studies, as a starting point for
future dedicated assessments of specific structure–function
relationships in this region. From the BrainMap database, 3D
activation coordinates in a standard reference space from published functional neuroimaging experiments as well as corresponding meta-data (Laird et al. 2009, Riedel et al. 2013) were
considered for the present analyses. The MPMs of each area in
pIPS and posterior wall of POS within the MNI152 reference
space were used as seed regions (after transformation from the
Colin27 space), separately for left and right hemisphere, resulting in 14 seed regions in total. Based on these MPMs, the
BrainMap database was searched for fMRI and positron emission tomography (PET) studies in healthy subjects, which
showed at least one focus of activation within the defined seed
regions. These requirements restricted the multitude of neuroimaging experiments within the BrainMap database to 3100 eligible experiments (at the time of analysis: August 2016), which
were used for this study.
For the functional decoding of each area in pIPS and posterior wall of POS area, the meta-data “Behavioral domains” and
“Paradigm classes” were used. Behavioral domains describe the
mental processes isolated by the experimental contrast,
whereas paradigm classes describe the experimental tasks that
[were used in the experiment (see http://www.brainmap.org/](http://www.brainmap.org/taxonomy/)
[taxonomy/). For each seed region, the frequency of behavioral](http://www.brainmap.org/taxonomy/)
domain and paradigm class “hits” was plotted against its likelihood across the entire database (Eickhoff et al. 2011). Only if
the behavioral domains or paradigm classes were significantly
overrepresented in a given seed region, for both the forward
inference and the reverse inference, they were included into
the functional profile of the seed. Forward inference P
(Activation│behavioral domain or paradigm class) reflected the
probability of finding activation in a seed region given a predefined behavioral domain or paradigm classes, whereas reverse
inference P(behavioral domain or paradigm class│Activation)
indicated the probability of being involved in a particular
behavioral domain or paradigm classes given activation in a
seed region. Significance was tested using a binomial test (P <
0.05, Bonferroni-corrected for multiple comparisons; Laird et al.
2009; Eickhoff et al. 2011).


-----

Whole-brain coactivation maps were generated to analyze
the functional connectivity of each area in pIPS and posterior
wall of POS area by using meta-analytic connectivity modeling
(MACM) and the modified Activation Likelihood Estimation
(ALE) algorithm (Turkeltaub et al. 2012, 2002; Eickhoff et al.
2016, 2012, 2009; Laird et al. 2009; Robinson et al. 2010). Using
the ALE algorithm, the reported coordinates from the eligible
functional studies were considered as spatial Gaussian probability distributions centered at the coordinates (Eickhoff et al.
2009). For each experiment, modeled activation maps were calculated by combining all probabilities for each voxel. The union
of these maps across all experiments provided voxel-wise ALE
scores, reflecting convergence of functional activation foci
across subjects. To test for “true” convergence, these ALE scores
were tested against an empirical null-hypothesis of random
spatial association of activation foci using permutation tests
(P < 0.05, family wise error (FWE)-corrected for multiple comparisons) (Eickhoff et al. 2016, 2012; Turkeltaub et al. 2012). The
final ALE maps reflected consistent coactivation across studies
with the seed region. Notably, highest convergence was
observed in each seed, as functional experiments were selected
based on their activation in this seed. The term functional connectivity will be used throughout the manuscript in the context
of coactivation patterns according to the MACM approach.
To investigate commonalities and differences in coactivation patterns of the seed regions in pIPS and posterior wall of
POS, conjunction and contrast analyses were performed using
the minimum statistic (Nichols et al. 2005). Contrast analyses
were performed by voxel-wise calculation of differences
between ALE maps of individual MACM analyses (Eickhoff et al.
2011). Contrast analyses were tested for significance against an
empirical null distribution (random assignment of experiments
to either seed region) using a permutation test with 10 000 repetitions. Results were considered significant if showing up in a
map thresholded at a posterior probability of P > 0.95. For further information, see Eickhoff et al. (2016, 2012, 2009).

### Results


area hPO1, whereas rostral medial pIPS area hIP8 bordered
hPO1 and SPL areas 7P and 7A. Area hPO1, located at the junction between pIPS and posterior wall of POS, bordered occipital
area hOc4d/V3A. Area hOc6 was found in the depth of posterior
wall of POS in the occipital lobe, abutting occipital areas hOc3d/
V3d and hOc2/V2. Despite substantial interindividual variability
in sulcal morphology of pIPS and POS, this topographical
arrangement of the seven areas in the pIPS and posterior wall
of POS was consistently found across all ten brains studied:
Areas hIP4, hIP5, and hIP6 were always found on the lateral
wall of pIPS, and areas hIP7 and hIP8 always on the medial wall
of pIPS, whereas hPO1 and hOC6 were always located on the
posterior POS wall, indicating a consistent relation between
sulci and cytoarchitectonic areas. Local peculiarities in topography of the areas in case the pIPS was a continuous or subdivided sulcus (with a rostral superficial and caudal deep branch)
are exemplarily shown in Fig. 4. In contrast, the POS appeared
as one continuous sulcus, with the occipital lobe forming its
posterior and the superior parietal lobule forming its anterior
wall. POS and pIPS were separated by a gyrus, whose width varied among individual brains.

##### Cytoarchitectonic Characteristics of Areas in the pIPS and Posterior Wall of POS


##### Topography of Seven Cytoarchitectonically Distinct Areas in pIPS and Posterior Wall of POS

Seven cytoarchitectonically distinct areas were identified within
human pIPS and posterior wall of POS (Fig. 3A). Areas hIP4-8 were
localized within pIPS, areas hPO1 and hOc6 on the posterior wall
of POS. High-resolution depictions of all cytoarchitectonic areas
(Figs 5–8) and their borders are available as supplementary highresolution figures for download (Supplementary Figs S1–S10).
Topographically, these seven areas covered the pIPS and
adjacent posterior wall of POS in between surrounding
cytoarchitectonic areas of caudal inferior parietal lobule (IPL:
areas PGa, PGp; Caspers et al. 2008, 2006) and superior parietal
lobule (SPL: areas 7A, 7P, 7M; Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al. 2008;
Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008), as well as anterior IPS (areas
hIP1, hIP2, hIP3; Choi et al. 2006; Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al.
2008; Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008) and dorsal occipital
cortex (areas hOc2, hOc3d/V3d, hOc4d/V3A; Amunts et al. 2000;
Kujovic et al. 2013) (Fig. 3A,B). From caudal to rostral, areas
hIP4-6 covered the lateral wall of pIPS, adjoining IPL areas PGa
and PGp, with hIP6 abutting anterior IPS areas hIP1 and hIP3
rostrally. Since the areas hIP4-6 partially encroach on the
medial wall of pIPS, they bordered medial pIPS areas hIP7 and

The lateral bank of pIPS was covered by cytoarchitectonic areas
hIP4-6, which differ between each other mainly in layers III and
layer V with regard to their cell packing density and size as well
as their width (Fig. 5A, Supplementary Fig. S1). From caudal to
rostral, hIP4 was replaced by hIP5 (Fig. 5B, Supplementary
Fig. S2), and hIP5 was displaced by hIP6 (Fig. 5C, Supplementary
Fig. S3), pushing it towards the fundus of the sulcus.
Rostral area hIP6 showed high cell packing density in all
layers, a narrower Layer III and a broader Layer VI in comparison
to the other lateral pIPS areas. Layer III was clearly delineated
from cell-dense Layer II, containing columns of pyramidal cells
with slight superficial-to-deep increase in size. With Layer IV
being very thin and less dense (local minimum of the mean GLI
profile; Fig. 5A, marked with a red arrow), Layer V was clearly
marked by evenly distributed pyramidal cells with diminishing
size from Layer Va to Vb, but being larger than those in Layer IIIc
and intermingling with cell dense Layer VI.
In contrast to area hIP6, hIP5 had lower cell density across all
layers, a broader Layer III with evenly distributed pyramidal cells,
a sparsely developed Layer IV, and a two-parted Layer V with a
cell-dense upper and cell-sparse lower part (Fig. 5C). Layer VI was
more discrete, with a sharp border to the white matter.
Contrarily, caudal area hIP4 was characterized by the widest
Layer III, which was two-parted, and the thinnest Layer V,
which could not be subdivided into sublayers. The bipartition
of Layer III was reflected by an abrupt change from a cellsparse superficial part with small, evenly distributed pyramidal
cells to a cell dense deep part with larger pyramids in columnar
arrangement. Thin Layer IV was clearly delimited from Layer III
(local minimum of the mean GLI profile; Fig. 5A, marked with a
red arrow), but interrupted by strands of large pyramidal cells
from thin and homogeneous Layer V.
Further cytoarchitectonic borders between lateral pIPS and
IPL areas PGa, PGp or medial anterior IPS area hIP3 were
depicted in the papers of Caspers et al. (2006) or Scheperjans,
Hermann et al. (2008).

Medial Bank of pIPS: Cytoarchitecture of Areas hIP7-8
The medial bank of pIPS was lined with hIP7 and hIP8, from
caudal to rostral, until they were replaced by anterior IPS area
hIP3 (Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008). The major cytoarchitectonic differences between the two medial areas hIP7 and
hIP8 were the overall cell density and the cell distribution in
Layer V (Fig. 6A, Supplementary Fig. S4).
Caudal area hIP7 appeared very homogeneous, with overall
high cell density and blurred transitions between layers. Layer
II was wider than in adjacent hIP8 (Fig. 6B, Supplementary
Fig. S5) and hIP4 (Fig. 7A, Supplementary Fig. S6). The broad
Layer III showed a columnar arrangement of pyramidal cells
with pronounced superficial-to-deep increase in cell size and
very large pyramids in Layer IIIc spreading into thin and cellsparse Layer IV (local GLI minimum; Fig. 6A, marked with a red
arrow). The latter applied also to the medium-sized pyramidal


neurons in Layer V, which continued into similarly structured,
cell dense Layer VI, which was broader than in hIP4 (Fig. 7A)
and hIP8 (Fig. 6B).
Rostromedial area hIP8 showed similar cytoarchitectonic
features as adjacent lateral area hIP5, with overall lower cell
density and a bipartite Layer V. Major differences to hIP5
resulted from a broader Layer III and thinner Layer V in hIP8
(Fig. 7B, Supplementary Fig. S7). Particularly an abrupt change
in size of pyramidal cells from superficial to deep parts of Layer
III as well as a cell-sparse light stripe between Layers IIIc and IV
in area hIP8 stood out in comparison with area hIP5 (local GLI
minimum; Fig. 6A, marked with a red arrow). Layer Va
appeared as a cell-dense dark stripe (local GLI maximum;
Fig. 6A, marked with a red star) in contrast to thin Layer IV and
cell-sparse Layer Vb, which was again clearly separable from
Layer VI.

hOc3d/V3d, hOc4d/V3A) is also shown. The areas are superimposed on histological sections of two individual post mortem brains used for cytoarchitectonic analyses.


Posterior Wall of POS: Cytoarchitecture of Areas hPO1, hOc6
The posterior wall of POS was covered by hPO1 and hOc6,
which could be distinguished cytoarchitectonically by homogeneity of Layer III and the width of Layer IV (Fig. 8).
Area hPO1 was characterized by a two-parted Layer III with
large pyramidal cells arranged in small groups in its deeper
part, reflected in a pronounced local GLI maximum (Fig. 8A:
marked with a red arrow, Supplementary Fig. S8). Layer IV was
thin and partly interrupted, but clearly separated from Layer III.
Layer V was rather homogeneous, with barely detectable sublayers. The border between Layer VI and the white matter was
clearly visible. In contrast to medial pIPS area hIP7, which bordered on hPO1 at the junction between pIPS and posterior wall
of POS, the size of pyramidal cells in lower Layer IIIc was


smaller and Layer V appeared brighter, due to a lower cell density in Layer V (Fig. 8B, Supplementary Fig. S9).
Area hOc6 was located more rostral in ventral aspects of the
posterior wall of POS and showed a more homogenous Layer
III, a wider Layer IV, and a thinner Layer V than hPO1 (Fig. 8A).
Layer II was sharply separated from Layer III, in which pyramidal cells were distributed more homogenously than in hPO1,
but still with a visible bipartition. The less dense but thin Layer
V contained evenly distributed pyramidal cells, with a few
larger ones close to Layer IV. The compact Layer VI had higher
cell density, which demarcated it from the white matter.
Compared with the occipital area hOc2/V2 (Amunts et al. 2000),
the gradient of pyramidal cell size in Layer III was smaller and
Layer IV thinner (Fig. 8C, Supplementary Fig. S10).

##### Hierarchical Cluster and Multidimensional Scaling Analysis of Cytoarchitectonic Features

The hierarchical cluster-analysis (Fig. 9A) and the multidimensional scaling (MDS) analysis (Fig. 9B) revealed a grouping of


the seven areas in pIPS and posterior wall of POS (averaged
across left and right hemisphere) into three main clusters: mediocaudal, rostral and lateral. Areas hPO1 and hIP7 were most
similar to each other. Both areas were characterized by prominent pyramidal cells in lower Layer IIIc, a local GLI minimum in


-----

position of Layer IV, and a cell dense Layer V with mediumsized pyramidal cells. Together with area hOc6, they formed the
mediocaudal cluster, which was distinct from both the rostral
and lateral pIPS clusters. MDS analysis additionally visualized
this shift across the clusters, as these were mainly separated in
the dimension of Score (1). Especially in the MDS analysis of
(Fig. 9B), area hOc6 appears as a fringe area, standing out from
all other areas, which further supports the notion of a being different from the other areas within pIPS and adjacent posterior
wall of POS. Cytoarchitectonic characteristics of the rostral cluster with areas hIP5 and hIP8 were a low overall cell density
across all cortical layers, and a two-parted Layer V with a local
GLI maximum corresponding to Layer Va. The lateral cluster,
consisting of areas hIP4 and hIP6, was characterized by homogeneity across all layers, and a small cleft between Layers IIIc and
IV. Overall, the mediocaudal and rostral clusters were more similar to each other as compared with the lateral cluster in terms
of cytoarchitecture. Notwithstanding, all pIPS and posterior wall
of POS areas show a high degree of similarity, as they are all part
of higher-order association cortex, which is particularly evident
from considerable intermingling of the individual data points in
the MDS analysis (Fig. 9B).

maps of all seven cytoarchitectonic areas in pIPS and posterior
wall of POS are made publicly available as part of the JuBrain

The corrected mean volumes of all areas in pIPS and posterior wall of POS and the corresponding standard deviation of the
left and right hemisphere are listed in Table 3. All areas within
pIPS (hIP4-8) were about the same size, in contrast to posterior
wall of POS area hPO1, which was the biggest, and area hOc6,
which was the smallest area. Interindividual variability in volume was most pronounced for area hPO1 and least for area
hOc6. The corrected volumes did not differ between the hemispheres nor between the sexes. Additionally, no interaction
between hemispheric and gender were found (all P > 0.05).

##### Quantitative Meta-Analysis


For each area in pIPS and posterior wall of POS, 3D continuous
probability maps were generated in the MNI-Colin27 reference
brain to quantify interindividual anatomical variability in their
localization and extent. The probability maps of all areas are

posterior wall of POS were assessed using the BrainMap database. In this study, all behavioral domains fell into three main
categories: cognition, perception and action. All areas in pIPS
and posterior wall of POS were involved in spatial cognition,
visual perception of motion and shape, working memory, and
attention. Compatible with this, all areas were activated during
tasks involving mental rotation, visuospatial attention, delayed
match to sample, and the Wisconsin card sorting test. Notably,
all areas of pIPS and posterior wall of POS in both hemispheres
were involved in spatial cognition, while visual perception of
motion was more associated with left-sided regions, particularly in rostro-lateral pIPS (areas hIP4-6 and hIP8). Rostral and
lateral pIPS (hIP4-6, hIP8) areas were additionally involved in
reasoning, language processing and orthography (hIP6), explicit
memory (hIP5) and action inhibition (hIP6,8), whereupon caudal
area hIP4 was just involved in reasoning. Only hIP5, hIP6, and
hIP8 were activated during counting and calculation tasks,
visual identification of objects and covert word generation
(only hIP5,6). In contrast, mediocaudal areas of pIPS and posterior wall of POS were associated with action observation (hIP7)
and visual perception of color (hPO1). Together with hIP4, they
were activated during visual tracking of moving targets. The


mediocaudal areas and the medial area hIP8 were activated
during saccades. No significant association of behavioral
domains or paradigm classes listed in the BrainMap database
was found for area hOc6.

MACM: Conjunction and Contrast Analyses
The conjunction of coactivation maps of all areas in pIPS and
posterior wall of POS, except hOc6, revealed a common network
of cortical and subcortical brain regions (Fig. 12A). This bilateral
network included the ventral and dorsal premotor cortex (PMC)
and the (pre)supplementary motor area (SMA and preSMA).
Additional coactivations were found bilaterally in the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), frontal operculum (FO) and anterior insula, area 44 (Broca’s region; Amunts et al. 1999), as well
as intraparietal areas. Compared with existing cytoarchitectonic
probability maps, the intraparietal activation contained the
anterior IPS areas hIP1, hIP2 (Choi et al. 2006), hIP3 (Scheperjans,
Eickhoff et al. 2008; Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008) and the
seed regions within the pIPS. Further significant coactivation of
areas of pIPS and posterior wall of POS was found in the dorsal
(dOC), ventral (vOC) and lateral occipital cortex (LOC), comprising

subcortical coactivations were bilaterally found in the basal ganglia, including caudate nucleus, putamen, and pallidum, and the

Contrast analysis was performed by grouping hIP4, hIP7,

rostral the areas were located, the higher the connectivity with
motor and prefrontal regions.

### Discussion


The present study provides a complete cytoarchitectonic map
of the human pIPS and adjacent posterior wall of POS. Using an
image analysis and statistical tests, borders of seven distinct
areas within the pIPS (hIP4-8) and adjacent posterior wall of
POS (hPO1, hOc6) were found, and areas were mapped over
their whole extent in series of histological sections of ten
human postmortem brains. As a result, 3D-probability maps of
the areas in pIPS and posterior POS in the MNI reference space
were generated, enabling direct comparison with in vivo data
from functional imaging studies. The probability maps were
then used as seed regions to identify structure–function relationships and whole-brain connectivity patterns of each
cytoarchitectonic area. Beside a common involvement of all
these areas in spatial and visual perception, working memory
and attention, a diagonal functional shift, i.e. change in functional assignment from visual information processing to higher
cognitive functions, was identified when moving from caudomedial to rostro-lateral areas of pIPS and posterior wall of POS.
This diagonal shift of functional involvement goes hand in
hand with a functional connectivity shift with (pre)frontal and
temporo-occipital areas.


##### Comparison of Present with Classical Maps of Human pIPS and Adjacent POS

In classical cytoarchitectonic human brain maps, e.g. by

Brodmann (1909) or von Economo and Koskinas (1925), the IPS
and adjacent POS were depicted as anatomical landmarks of
the parietal and occipital lobes. In Brodmann’s map, the IPS
divides the PPC into SPL and IPL, separating inferior parietal
areas BA40 and BA39 from superior parietal areas BA5 and BA7,
whereas the adjacent POS separates parietal area BA7 from
occipital area BA19 (Fig. 1). In the map of von Economo and
Koskinas (1925), the IPS was also not parcellated in detail, but
covered by two adjacent areas encroaching from the postcentral sulcus (area PD) and SPL (area PE) into the IPS. The adjacent
POS was assigned to SPL area PEγ and occipital area OA. In contrast to these two maps, Gerhardt (1940) parcellated the region
around and within the IPS into a mosaic of 15 areas, encompassing main areas 86–90 and corresponding subareas (Fig. 1).
This parcellation was based on a single hemisphere, though,
without replication of all findings in other brains, leaving this
map largely neglected (Zilles and Palomero-Gallagher 2001).
Thus, there is a mismatch between recent data on the organization of pIPS and posterior wall of POS as revealed by functional imaging studies in humans or cytoarchitectonical
mapping studies in monkeys on the one hand, and current
knowledge on the microstructural organization of this region in
humans on the other. The current findings of five cytoarchitectonically distinct pIPS areas (hIP4-8) addressed this problem,
providing a structural correlate for the functional heterogeneity
of this region. The present maps extend previous research on
anterior IPS (lateral wall: areas hIP1 and hIP2, Choi et al. 2006;
medial wall: area hIP3, Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al. 2008;
Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008).

the sections are given in the original Colin27-MNI reference space.


The newly described areas in pIPS areas were localized
within the IPS, and rarely reach the lateral surface. This is in
correspondence to the anterior IPS areas and the situation in
monkeys (for an overview, see Grefkes and Fink 2005). In addition, two new areas within the adjacent posterior wall of POS
(hPO1, hOc6) linked parietal with occipital cortex by common
borders with visual areas like hOc4d/V3A, hOc3d/V3d, and
hOc2/V2 (Amunts et al. 2000; Kujovic et al. 2013). The topographical attributes of the areas as belonging either to the parietal or occipital lobe were also reflected by their overall


cytoarchitecture: the pIPS areas (hIP4-8) showed features of the
“parietal type” as indicated by von Economo and Koskinas
(1925), and were characterized by medium cortical width and
medium-sized pyramidal cells in a broad layer III. Area hOc6
can be interpreted as the “polar type” with a smaller cortical
width and a broader Layer IV. Lying at the transition between
pIPS and POS, area hPO1 represents some kind of transitional
area, showing aspects of both the parietal and polar type.
Extent and size of the areas varied between brains. The new
maps of areas in pIPS and posterior wall POS accounted for this

which might be attributable to its constant position next to
visual area V2, of which the location was also rather invariant
(Amunts et al. 2000). The 3D-probability maps of pIPS and posterior wall of POS in the MNI reference space are directly comparable to results from neuroimaging studies to further analyze
their functional role.

interindividual variability by integrating delineations from 10
individual brains. The final probability maps in the standard
reference brain thus quantify for each voxel the likelihood of
finding the given pIPS and POS area in this particular location.
In contrast to classical brain maps, this allows quantitative
assessment of structure–function relationships in this complex
brain region. Part of this variability can be attributed to overall
sulcal morphology, which particularly holds for the human IPS
(present findings; Ono et al. 1990; Ebeling and Steinmetz 1995;
Choi et al. 2006; Zlatkina and Petrides 2014), whereas human
POS macroanatomically typically appears as a continuous sulcus (Ono et al. 1990; Malikovic et al. 2012). By non-linear registration of the individual delineations to the standard reference
brain, these individual peculiarities in sulcal morphology are
accounted for, with a good mapping of the diversity of the individual sulcal configurations on the anatomy of the pIPS and
POS in the standard reference brain. Despite this variability,
each area in pIPS and posterior wall of POS occupied a consistent core region (Fig 10, red) across individuals as depicted by
the central high-overlap regions in the 3D-probability maps.
Interindividual variability was lowest for area hOc6, though,


As revealed by the present meta-analysis and known from
numerous functional imaging studies, the IPS in general is
involved in a large variety of tasks and functional domains.
With the meta-analysis providing an overall organization of
structure–function relationships in this brain region and as
dedicated future studies are needed to reveal specific associations between the structural parcellation and the functional
heterogeneity, the subsequent paragraphs focus on those
aspects with contributed most to the observed functional shift
across the IPS and adjacent POS areas.
Relating the new maps to visuotopically defined ones provides additional insight into their putative functional role.
Visuotopic maps have been described repeatedly (Silver et al.
2005; Kastner et al. 2007; Swisher et al. 2007; Konen and
Kastner 2008a; Silver and Kastner 2009; Henriksson et al. 2012)
and recently published as a probabilistic atlas (Wang et al.
2015). Areas of this atlas along the caudo-rostral axis of the
IPS, namely IPS0-IPS5 and SPL1, were identified using a
memory-guided saccade task and covered mainly the medial
bank of the IPS as well as adjacent aspects of superior parietal
cortex. Overlaying these topographic maps with the 3Dprobability maps of the new cytoarchitectonic areas identified
in the present study reveals correspondences between area
hIP7 of the present study and area IPS0 as well as between
area hIP8 of the present study and area IPS1. Area hIP4 partially also overlapped with IPS0 within the bottom of pIPS. The
other areas of the present study were located either medially
(hPO1, hOc6) or laterally (hIP4, hIP5, hIP6) to these visuotopically defined areas by Wang et al. (2015). As the latter were
identified using a visual task on memory-guided saccades,
such correspondence between the here identified cytoarchitectonic areas hIP7 and hIP8 and the visuotopic maps IPS0 and
IPS1 might provide first insight into the functional involvement of the newly described areas of the present study. The
results of the present meta-analysis on general functional
involvement and network integration of these areas across a
multitude of individual neuroimaging studies provided additional insights into this putative structure–function correspondence. Similar to the memory-guided saccade task used to
identify the visuotopic areas in PPC (Konen and Kastner 2008a;
Silver and Kastner 2009; Wang et al. 2015), we also found consistent activation related to saccades in our meta-analysis particularly within these medial pIPS areas hIP7 and hIP8 which
overlapped with the visuotopic areas IPS0 and IPS1. While
these saccade-related activation patterns also spread to the
medially adjacent area hPO1 in the posterior wall of POS, additional visual perceptive functions such as visual pursuit and
tracking additionally involved laterally adjacent pIPS area hIP4.
Such differential, but partially overlapping involvement of pIPS
regions for these visual perceptive abilities might add to
reports on different, but not completely separated processing
streams (Berman et al. 1999; Petit and Haxby 1999; Silver and
Kastner 2009). Linking this to cytoarchitectonic features
showed that particularly these areas hPO1 and hIP7 shared

POS areas, as well as common behavioral domains and paradigm classes (marked with a symbol), highlighted a diagonal functional shift within the pIPS and posterior wall of POS from rostral and lateral pIPS areas (hIP5,6) to mediocaudal pIPS and posterior wall of POS areas (hIP7, hPO1). Areas hIP4 and hIP8 represented transi
tional zones between these two poles.


common characteristics as revealed by the cytoarchitectonic
cluster analysis, e.g., very prominent pyramidal cells in layer
IIIc and high cell density in layer V, typical features of extrastriate visual areas (von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Amunts
et al. 2000; Kujovic et al. 2013; Malikovic et al. 2007, 2016),
underpinning their involvement in visual processing.
A further distinction between the pIPS and medially adjacent POS area hPO1 could also be revealed, though: While all
pIPS and POS areas were involved in spatial cognition and
working memory tasks, mainly in concert with several


prefrontal regions (comparable to the so-called “task-positive
network”: Fox et al. 2005; Rottschy et al. 2012; Müller et al.
2015), only the pIPS areas were involved in attentional processes. The topographic maps IPS0 and IPS1 (Wang et al. 2015)
identified using the memory-guided saccade task which particularly involved covert shifts of attention (Kastner et al. 2007;
Konen and Kastner 2008a) overlapped with pIPS, but not POS
areas. This might further hint at a distinction between basic
extrastriate visual processing in hPO1 and higher associative
visual and non-visual functions in pIPS.

Figure 12. Significant results of MACM analysis. (A) Conjunction analysis of the coactivation maps of all areas in pIPS and posterior wall of POS, except hOc6, repre
sented on the MNI-Colin27 reference brain. This bilateral network of significant coactivations included the ventral (vPMC) and dorsal premotor cortex (dPMC), (pre)
supplementary motor area ((pre)SMA), ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC), frontal operculum (FO) and anterior insula (aIns), area 44 (Broca region; Amunts et al.

1999), anterior IPS (aIPS) areas hIP1, hIP2 (Choi et al. 2006), and hIP3 (Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al. 2008; Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008), lateral occipital cortex (LOC):

hOc4lp, hOc4la (Malikovic et al. 2016), and area hOc5 (V5/MT+, Malikovic et al. 2007), ventral occipital cortex (vOC): FG1, FG2 (Caspers et al. 2013), dorsal occipital cor
tex (dOC): hOc4d/V3A (Kujovic et al. 2013), as well as subcortical coactivations within the basal ganglia (BG), including caudate nucleus, putamen, and pallidum, and
the medial nuclear group of the thalamus (mThal). (B) Contrast analysis between the coactivation maps of the caudal cluster (hIP4, hIP7, hPO1; yellow–orange) and

the rostral cluster (hIP5,6,8; green–blue) on the MNI-Colin27 reference brain. The rostral cluster (green–blue) showed predominant functional connectivity with ventral

and dorsal PMC, (pre)SMA, vlPFC, aIPS areas hIP1, hIP2, and hIP3, aIns and FO, the putamen and the medial nuclear group of the thalamus, as well as with the cerebel
lum (Cer). In contrast, the caudal cluster (yellow–orange) showed more pronounced bilateral connectivity with areas FG1, FG2, hOc4la, hOc4d/V3A and hOc5 (V5/MT+).


Furthermore, these focused relations between some of the
visuotopic and some of the cytoarchitectonic maps of the present study suggest an overall differential involvement of the
caudo-medio cytoarchitectonic areas of pIPS and POS in functional brain networks as compared with the laterally and rostrally adjacent cytoarchitectonic pIPS areas. For the visuotopic
areas, higher functional and structural connectivity to early
visual and adjacent temporal cortex for a posterior group of
areas was described, while the anterior visuotopic IPS areas
had stronger functional and structural connectivity with prefrontal areas (Uddin et al. 2010; Greenberg et al. 2012; Bray et al.
2013). The current contrast analysis of coactivation patterns
complements these observations in terms of similar differences
in functional connectivity: while caudal areas hIP4, hIP7, and
hPO1 had stronger bilateral connectivity with early visual and


occipito-temporal cortex, rostral areas hIP5, hIP6, and hIP8
were stronger connected with motor, frontal opercular and prefrontal cortex. This diagonal shift in connectivity from caudomedial to rostro-lateral was indeed also reflected on the level
of functional involvement in our present meta-analysis, with
the rostro-lateral areas being more involved in higher cognitive
functions such as reasoning, counting and calculation, or
action inhibition.
The current database-driven meta-analytic approach was
thus able to reveal a functional and connectional shift across
the pIPS and POS areas identified in the present study, which is
mirrored by a respective shift in cytoarchitectonic features of
the areas. While the mediocaudal cluster of areas hIP7, hPO1,
and hOc6 was characterized by large pyramidal cells in layer
IIIc and thus resembled typical visual areas (see above), the

Figure 13. Comparison of IPS and adjacent POS parcellations in (A) the macaque monkey and (B) the human brain. The human parcellation is based on the newly

defined areas of the present study (colored areas) as well as previously mapped areas in rostral IPS (hIP1, hIP2, hIP3: Choi et al. 2006; Scheperjans, Eickhoff et al. 2008;

Scheperjans, Hermann et al. 2008) and primary, secondary and dorsal visual cortex (V1, V2: Amunts et al. 2000; V3A, V3d: Kujovic et al. 2013). The macaque monkey

parcellation scheme is a summarized depiction of areas in IPS, POS and lunate sulcus (LS) in the left hemisphere (dorsal view, modified from Galletti et al. 2003).
Relevant sulci are depicted open (in gray). Several distinct visual (V) and intraparietal (IP) areas, named after their topographical positions within the sulci, are labeled

according to Felleman and van Essen 1991; Lewis and van Essen 2000; Cavada et al. 2000; Galletti et al. 2003; PIP = posterior IP, CIP = caudal IP, MIP = medial IP, LIP =

lateral IP, VIP = ventral IP, AIP = anterior IP.


lateral and rostral areas all showed more homogeneously distributed medium-sized pyramidal cells typically associated
with the parietal cortex type, particularly the inferior parietal
cortex, with which rostro-lateral areas hIP4, hIP5, and hIP6
share common borders (von Economo and Koskinas 1925;
Caspers et al. 2006, 2008). While these global shifts in microstructure and overall brain network integration might provide
first hints, specific structure–function relationships of these
newly identified cytoarchitectonic areas in human pIPS and
adjacent posterior wall of POS need to be further elucidated in
dedicated, well-controlled neuroimaging experiments. At this,
methodical peculiarities of the performed meta-analysis need
to be taken into account, such as effects of smoothing, generalization across a variety of studies under a summarizing label,
relative selectivity of studies, behavioral domains and paradigm classes stored within the database and biased towards
tasks in a standard scanner-setting (for additional information
about potential and limitations of meta-analytic approaches,
see e.g. Fox et al. 2014; Genon et al. 2018). The results of the current quantitative meta-analysis thus revealed a general organizational principle of structure–function relationships in human
pIPS and adjacent POS and can thus serve as starting point for
future dedicated assessments of the relation between functions
and microstructurally defined areas using specific functional
paradigms. This might have left relevant and well-studied abilities associated with pIPS, such as the ability to process 3D
visual information which might involve caudal IPS and


adjacent dorsal visual stream (Tsao et al. 2003; Jastorff et al.
2016; Welchmann 2016), or the question of specific vs. unspecific activations as, e.g. the case for action observation for
which highly specific activations are typically found in rostral
IPS (Ferri et al. 2015; Corbo and Orban 2017), out of the picture.
It might also explain why for POS area hOc6 no significant associations with particular functions were found. Here, the
cytoarchitectonic cluster analysis might provide additional
insight that hOc6 might be involved in similar functions as
areas hIP7 and hPO1 as they together form the mediocaudal
cytoarchitectonic cluster.

##### Similar Topographical Arrangement of Areas in Human and Monkey pIPS and POS

The new maps of human pIPS and adjacent posterior wall of
POS could furthermore add to the discussion on putative
homologies in this region between humans and monkeys (for
review: Grefkes and Fink 2005).
Focusing only on topographical organizational principles
within monkey and human IPS and POS, a prominent similarity
in number and topographical arrangement of pIPS and POS
areas in humans and monkeys can be observed (Fig. 13). In
both species, cytoarchitectonically identified areas are located
mainly on a particular wall of the IPS or POS, either on the lateral or the medial wall. Additionally, all identified areas reside
within the sulcus and hardly extend onto the free surface (for


-----

the monkey IPS see e.g., Grefkes and Fink 2005). In monkeys,
the lateral wall of the IPS consists (from rostral to caudal) of
areas AIP, VIP (in the bottom of the sulcus, potential subdivision into VIPm and VIPl), LIP (potential subdivision into LIPv
and LIPd), and CIP (Seltzer and Pandya 1986, 1980; Colby et al.
1988; Andersen et al. 1990; Blatt et al. 1990; Felleman and van
Essen 1991; Cavada et al. 2000; Lewis and van Essen 2000;
Galletti et al. 2003). In a similar topographical arrangement
from rostral to caudal, the lateral wall of human IPS consists of
areas hIP2, hIP1 (in the bottom of the sulcus), hIP6, hIP5, and
hIP4. Thus, in both species, there is a comparable topography
with 4–5 rostro-caudally arranged distinct areas. The same
holds true for the medial wall of IPS: in monkeys, there are
from rostral to caudal medial area MIP and posterior area PIP,
whereas in humans, there are (also from rostral to caudal)
areas hIP3, hIP8, and hIP7. The overall topography of areas in
human and monkey IPS seems to be comparable. Whether this
topographical comparability relates to microstructural and
functional similarity needs to be elucidated in future dedicated
comparative studies. It could, e.g. be shown that typical lateral
IPS functions (such as involvement in visuospatial attention
and saccades) in monkeys is covered by medially located IPS
areas and adjacent cortical regions in humans (for review, see
Grefkes and Fink 2005; Orban 2016), which is further supported
by our current meta-analysis (see section 4.2). The present
results might add the yet missing link on putative structural–
functional homologies in human and monkey IPS by providing
maps of microstructurally defined, yet unavailable areas for
human pIPS.
The topography of areas in the posterior wall of POS in monkeys and humans appears not as comparable as for the pIPS. In
monkeys, the posterior wall of POS is mainly covered by dorsal
parts of visual areas V2 and V3 (Gamberini et al. 2015), followed
by area V6 in the bottom of the sulcus and area V6A (PO), which
is already located on the anterior wall (Galletti et al. 1996, 1997,
2003; Gamberini et al. 2015). In humans, though, areas hOc2
(V2), hOc3d (V3d), and hOc4d (V3A) were mainly located within
the occipital lobe, only encroaching on the posterior wall of
POS (Amunts et al. 2000; Kujovic et al. 2013). Area hPO1 identified in the present study filled the yet uncharted part of the
posterior wall of human POS, adjacent to area V3A and the also
newly identified area hOc6 caudally and in close proximity to
medial pIPS area hIP7 and hIP8 (Fig. 13), resembling the situation for area V6A in monkeys. The here described areas in the
posterior wall of human POS (hPO1, hOc6) might provide an
additional structural basis for further elucidating the potential
homology in this region, including the discussion on potential
human homologs of areas V6 and V6A (Tzelepi et al. 2001;
Vanni et al. 2001; Dechent and Frahm 2003; Fattori et al. 2009;
Cavina-Pratesi et al. 2010; Pitzalis et al. 2006, 2010, 2015).

### Conclusions


as a major organizational principle in this region, mirrored by
differential functional connectivity with (pre)frontal and
temporo-occipital areas. The architectonical complexity of
human pIPS and adjacent POS and the resulting functional and
connectional diversity may contribute to the understanding of
the functional relevance of human IPS and adjacent POS for
visual processing and cognitive functions. These new 3D
cytoarchitectonic maps of human pIPS and adjacent POS can
now be used as an anatomical fundament to link the functional
heterogeneity of this region to a similarly complex mosaic of
structural areas.

The present study provides the first cytoarchitectonical maps
of human pIPS and adjacent posterior wall of POS using an
observer-independent, quantitative mapping approach in 10
human post mortem brains. Seven cytoarchitectonically distinct areas within pIPS (hIP4-8) and adjacent posterior wall of
POS (hPO1, hOc6) were identified. Beside the common functional involvement of all areas in pIPS and posterior wall of
POS, except hOc6, in visuomotor integration, working memory
and attention, a diagonal functional shift within human pIPS
and adjacent POS from visual processing to higher cognitive
functions like orthography and calculation could be established
