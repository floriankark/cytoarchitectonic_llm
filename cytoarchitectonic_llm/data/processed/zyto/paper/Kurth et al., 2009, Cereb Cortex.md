# Cytoarchitecture and Probabilistic Maps of the Human Posterior Insular Cortex

The human posterior insula was shown to respond to a wide variety
of stimulation paradigms (e.g. pain, somatosensory, or auditory
processing) in functional imaging experiments. Although various
anatomical maps of this region have been published over the last
century, these schemes show variable results. Moreover, none can
directly be integrated with functional imaging data. Hence, our
current knowledge about the structure--function relationships in this
region remains limited. We therefore remapped the posterior part of
the human insular cortex in 10 postmortem brains using an observerindependent approach. This analysis revealed the existence of 3
cytoarchitectonically distinct areas in the posterior insula. The
examined brains were then 3D reconstructed and spatially
normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute single-subject
template. Probabilistic maps for each area were calculated by
superimposing the individual delineations, and a cytoarchitectonic
summary map was computed to chart the regional architectonic
organization. These maps can be used to identify the anatomical
correlates of functional activations observed in neuroimaging studies
and to understand the microstructural correlates of the functional
segregation of the human posterior insula.

Introduction

The human insular cortex is located in the depth of the Sylvian
fissure and covered by the frontal, parietal, and temporal
opercular lobes due to the differential growth patterns of these
regions during ontogenesis. It is demarcated from the adjacent
parts of the cortex by the circular sulcus of Reil consisting of
the superior limiting part (macroscopic border toward the
frontoparietal operculum) and an inferior limiting sulcus
(macroscopic border toward the temporal lobe) (Mesulam
and Mufson 1985; Zilles 2004). Commonly, 5--7 sulci running in
a radial orientation toward the insular pole are distinguished
(Morgane et al. 1980; Ono et al. 1990; Naidich et al. 2004),
which divide the insula into 2 long, 2--3 short, and a variable
accessory gyrus. The central sulcus of the insula is considered
to represent the border between the anterior and the smaller
posterior insula. The latter region, which is the focus of the
present analysis, consists of the anterior and posterior long
gyrus separated by the insular postcentral sulcus (von
Economo and Koskinas 1925; Naidich et al. 2004).
In neuroimaging experiments using functional magnetic
resonance imaging (fMRI) or positron emission tomography,
the posterior insula has been implicated in the cortical
processing of a wide variety of different stimuli. In particular,
this region was repeatedly shown to process painful (Ostrowsky
et al 2002; Frot and Mauguiere 2003; Alkire et al 2004;

et al. 2005), auditory (Bamiou et al. 2003), vestibular stimuli
(Fasold et al. 2002; Fink et al. 2003), and motor tasks (JohansenBerg and Matthews 2002; Carey et al. 2005; Loubinoux et al.
2007).
The microstructure of the human insula, that is, the putative
anatomical substrate of these functions, has repeatedly been
studied over the last century. Some classical publications
(Brodmann 1909; von Economo and Koskinas 1925) distinguished a posterior granular and an anterior dysgranular or
agranular part separated by the central insular sulcus (Fig. 1),
whereas others (Vogt C and Vogt O 1919; Rose 1928) reported
a more detailed parceling of this region based on a comparison
with nonhuman primates and by combining cytoarchitecture
and myeloarchitecture. In a recent, very influential scheme
based on work in nonhuman primates (Mesulam and Mufson
1985), the concept of ‘‘granularity’’ (presence and characteristics of an inner granular layer) was proposed as a key feature
for the architectonic subdivision of the insular lobe (Fig. 2).
The resulting map describes a circular organization of cortical
areas around the insular pole. In particular, a central allocortical
polar region is encircled by an agranular belt, which is again
enclosed by a dysgranular one. The posterior insula is covered
by a granular region bordered by the dysgranular belt.
The question how the reported functional diversity of the
posterior insula maps to its architectonic structure is yet
unresolved as a direct comparison of classical brain maps and
functional imaging data are problematical for several reasons:
First of all, it has to be emphasized that all classical architectonic
maps purely relied on visual inspection of histological sections,
using subjective nonstandardized criteria and very small sample
sizes. This presumably led to the differences in the available
maps described above, which evidently question the generalizability of such maps for anatomical reference (Zilles et al. 2003).
Second, classical cytoarchitectonic maps are only available as
schematic drawings and hence cannot be matched with the 3D
data sets resulting from neuroimaging experiments. Furthermore, these atlases also lack information about intersubject
variability in the size and extent of cortical areas provoking the
misleading view that a particular cortical location is necessary
and in all subjects corresponding to a particular area. Finally, it
has to be emphasized that most influential anatomical data in the
insular cortex are derived from studies in nonhuman primates
(Mesulam and Mufson 1985). Though a basic comparability
between the insular cortex of humans and nonhuman primates
can be assumed, straightforward extrapolations must be
discussed with caution.
The aim of the present study was therefore to analyze the
cytoarchitecture of the human posterior insula in serial

histological sections of 10 human postmortem brains using
a statistical approach for the observer-independent detection of
borders between cortical areas (Schleicher et al. 2005). The
results of this mapping study will then be described by


Ten human postmortem brains (5 males and 5 females; see Table 1) of
subjects without a clinical history of neurological or psychiatric
diseases were obtained from the body donor program of the Anatomical
Institute of the University of Du¨ sseldorf according to legal requirements. Handedness was unknown, but assuming a 90% incidence of
right-handedness (Annett 1973), most subjects should have been righthanded. The brains were removed from the skull within 24 h after
death and fixed in formalin or Bodian’s fixative for about 6 months.
They were then scanned with a T1-weighted 3D FLASH sequence (flip
angle 40�, repetition time = 40 ms, time echo = 5 ms) using a Siemens
1.5-T scanner (Erlangen, Germany) to obtain 3D data sets documenting
brain size and shape. Subsequently, the whole brains were embedded in
paraffin and serially cut into coronary sections of 20 lm thickness.
Every 15th section was stained for cell bodies using a silver staining
method (Merker 1983) optimized to yield a high contrast between
darkly stained cell bodies and light neuropil. Every fourth stained
section (60th overall) was then analyzed, resulting in a distance of 1.2
mm between examined sections (Fig. 3).

Observer-Independent Detection of Cortical Borders
Cortical borders were identified using the approach described in detail
by Schleicher et al. (2005). In short, rectangular regions of interest
covering the posterior insula and neighboring cortex were defined
in the histological sections digitized in a meander-like sequence

using a motorized scanning microscope (KS-400; Zeiss, Oberkochen,
Germany) and a CCD camera (Sony, Tokyo, Japan, resolution
1.01 3 1.01 lm[2] per pixel), and transformed into gray-level index
(GLI) images. In these images, the values of individual pixels summarize
the areal fraction of darkly stained cell bodies in the corresponding
measuring field as estimated by adaptive thresholding (Schleicher and
Zilles 1990). Equidistant GLI profiles were then extracted perpendicular to the cortical layers (see Schleicher et al. 2000) between the layer
I/II border (outer boundary) and the transition between layer VI and
the white matter (inner boundary). These profiles hence quantify the
regional shape of the laminar cell density pattern (Eickhoff, Schleicher,
et al. 2007). The shape of each profile was quantified by a vector of 10
features based on central moments (mean GLI, mean X, standard
deviation [SD], skewness, and kurtosis of the profile and their
derivatives; Dixon et al. 1988; Zilles et al. 2002).
Differences between feature vectors indicate differences in the
profile shape, that is, in cytoarchitecture, and were measured using the
Mahalanobis distance (Mahalanobis et al. 1949; Schleicher et al. 2005).
To increase the signal to noise ratio, distances were calculated between
average feature vectors obtained from blocks of b (8 < b < 20)
adjacent profiles instead of individual profiles. They were analyzed in
a sliding window technique as a function of the profile number of the
border between the blocks (Fig. 4). Maxima of this distance function
revealed those positions where the regions covered by the 2 blocks
showed the most dissimilar laminar patterns. The significance of these
maxima was evaluated by a Hotelling’s T[2]-test with Bonferroni
correction for multiple comparisons (Fig. 4). The position of
a significant maximum was interpreted as a cortical border, if 1) it
was consistently present across multiple block sizes, that is, widths of
the sliding window, 2) no higher maximum was found within one block
size at either side, and 3) that maximum could be reproduced at
comparable positions in adjacent sections. These criteria in combination with the statistical assessment of the Mahalanobis distance
function allowed discharging local inhomogeneities in cytoarchitecture
revealing only borders between distinct cortical areas.

Interareal, Interhemispheric, and Interindividual Differences
For further characterization of the resulting cytoarchitectonic areas,
we analyzed differences in cytoarchitecture and volumes between all
areas. For each subject, area, and hemisphere, approximately 80
individual profiles were sampled evenly throughout its extent for
further statistical analysis. All extracted profiles were obtained from
regions that were free of histological artifacts and showed a perpendicular orientation of the sectioning plane to the cortical surface. From
this sample of profiles, mean feature vectors were calculated for each
subject, area, and hemisphere to quantify the individual areal-specific
cytoarchitecture. Such mean cytoarchitectonic profiles were obtained
for all delineated areas in the posterior insula and, in addition, also for
the anteriorly adjacent agranular insular cortex. The similarity in
cytoarchitectonic pattern between these areas—as indicated by their
mean profiles—was assessed by a hierarchical cluster analysis based on
profile shape. To this end, the feature vectors extracted from the GLI
profiles were transformed to z-scores in order to make the features
with their different metrics comparable. Subsequently, they were
averaged across hemispheres for each area and side resulting in 8 areal
feature vectors. The hierarchical cluster analysis was based on these
feature vectors and used the Euclidean distance measure and the Ward
linkage procedure (Dombrowski et al. 2001; Amunts et al. 2007). To
statistically establish different clusters, the root mean square standard
deviation (RMSSTD) index was applied (Sharma 1995), and the
Euclidean distances for intracluster and intercluster differences were
calculated. Interindividual and interareal differences in laminar pattern
were assessed using a multivariate repeated measurement analysis of
variance (ANOVA) with area and side (hemisphere) as within factors
and subject as blocking factor in order to eliminate the marked
interindividual variability. The analysis comprised 80 individual mean
feature vectors (comprising brains, 2 hemispheres, and 4 areas). Due to
the small sample size (resulting in too few degrees of freedom), the
putative confounding variables age, gender, and side were analyzed in
a separate ANOVA and a multivariate regression analysis.
The histological volumes (in cubic millimeters) of the delineated
areas in the left and right hemispheres were calculated from area
measurements (Ai) in images of the individual histological section (i)
using the formula V =s3x 3y 3+Ai 3F, where s is the distance between
2 measured sections (1.2 mm), x and y are the width and height of
a pixel in the image (0.02116 mm each), and +Ai is the sum of areas
across all i evaluated sections (in pixels). F is the individual shrinkage
factor of each brain calculated as ratios between the fresh volume of
a brain and the volume reconstructed from its histological sections. The
fresh volumes are the fresh weight of the brain 3 its mean specific
density of 1.033 (Kretschmann et al. 1982). The resulting volumetric
data were investigated by a repeated measurement ANOVA using the
following design—between-subject factor: gender; within-subject
factors: area and side; and blocking factor: subject.

Computation of Probabilistic Cytoarchitectonic Maps
The histological volumes of the brains were 3D reconstructed (Amunts
et al. 2004) using 1) the 3D magnetic resonance imaging scan, 2) the

of the data set orthogonal to the cutting plane, and (iii) digitized images
of the highly deformed cell body--stained sections. The defined areas
were then interactively transferred to the respective sections of the
reconstructed volume. The reconstructed brains were normalized to
the stereotactic space of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI)
single-subject template using a combination of affine transformations
and nonlinear elastic registration (Hoemke 2006). To maintain the
anterior commissure as the anatomical reference of the coordinate
system as described in previous cytoarchitectonic studies (e.g. Amunts
et al. 2005; Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006; Malikovic et al. 2007;
Rottschy et al. 2007), the data were shifted by 4 mm (y-axis) and 5 mm
(z-axis) to ‘‘anatomical MNI space’’ (Amunts et al. 2005). Following
spatial normalization, the corresponding areas of the different subjects
were superimposed and a probabilistic map was generated for each
area (Zilles et al. 2002). This map describes for each voxel of the
reference brain how many individual brains overlapped with the
respective cytoarchitectonic area in that particular voxel (Eickhoff,
Paus, et al. 2007).
A maximum probability map (MPM) of these probabilistic maps, that
is, a summary map of all defined areas, was then computed by
comparing the probabilities for each area (i.e. the numbers of
overlapping representations) in each voxel (Eickhoff et al. 2005a) and
assigning each voxel to the most likely anatomical area. If different
areas showed equally high probabilities for occurring in the same voxel,
this voxel was assigned to that area which showed the higher average
probability in the 26 directly adjacent voxels.

Results

Using the observer-independent approach for the definition of
cortical borders we identified 3 cytoarchitectonically distinct


areas in the posterior insular cortex. Two of these featured
a well-developed inner granular layer (layer IV) and may hence
be classified as ‘‘granular’’ following the concept of Mesulam
and Mufson (1985). In the third area, layer IV was thin and less
distinct due to intermingling pyramidal cells from lower layer
III, rendering it dysgranular. The 2 granular areas will be
referred to as Ig1 and Ig2 (‘‘I’’ for ‘‘insular lobe,’’ ‘‘g’’ for granular
areas, and a consecutive dorsal-to-frontal numbering) and the
dysgranular one as Id1 (‘‘d’’ for dysgranular area).

Cytoarchitecture
Ig1 is a granular area characterized by a well-developed and
clearly demarcated layer IV as indicated by a corresponding peak
in the GLI profile (see Fig. 5a). The cortex of Ig1 is thick with
wider supragranular than infragranular layers and consists
predominantly of small cells with high packing density. Layer II
is broad and its border to layer III is blurred. Layer III in turn is
made up of numerous small and densely packed pyramidal cells
without conspicuous subdivisions or size and density gradients,
respectively. Following the well-demarcated inner granular layer
IV, layer V contains mainly loosely packed smaller cells. It is
followed by layer VI that features no conspicuous increase in cell
density as compared with layer V. The white matter border is
relatively sharp. This laminar pattern was quantified by the
corresponding GLI profile showing a rather homogenous GLI
with a single distinct peak corresponding to the granular layer IV.
Area Ig2 can also be characterized as granular based on its
wide and clearly distinguishable layer IV (see Fig 5b)

A broad layer II and a less distinct layer V distinguish Ig1 from adjacent areas. (b) Cytoarchitecture of area Ig2, which also shows a clearly visible layer IV. Ig2 differs from Ig1 by
a smaller layer II, a less cell-dense middle part of layer III, and a cell-denser layer V. (c) Cytoarchitecture of area Id1. Layer IV is invaded by pyramidal cells from adjacent layers III
and V. This area has, therefore, a dysgranular architecture. Additionally, a less cell-dense layer III distinguishes Id1 from neighboring areas. (d) The flatmap shows the posterior
insula, which consists of 2 granular areas Ig1 and Ig2. Both areas are adjacent to the more rostral dysgranular region Id1.


-----

Following a relatively densely packed layer II, layer III shows
a distinct subdivision into a relatively cell sparse upper part
(IIIa + b) and a lower part (IIIc) featuring more prominent
pyramidal cells. The inner granular layer (IV) is well developed
and clearly discernable from the adjacent pyramidal cell layers.
The infragranular layers generally show a higher cell packing
density as compared with the supragranular ones. Layer V
contains medium-sized and densely packed pyramidal cells.
The transition between layer VI and the white matter is blurred
by radiating cell columns. The architectonic features of area Ig2
are well reflected by the GLI profile featuring a higher volume
fraction of cell bodies in the infragranular layers, a conspicuous
sublamination of layer III, and a distinct peak corresponding to
layer IV.
Area Id1 features a lower overall cell density as compared
with the previously described areas and also shows a considerably less distinctly developed layer IV characterizing it as
dysgranular (see Fig. 5c). As in Ig2, the cell density is higher in
the infragranular part. Layer II is broad, loosely packed with
small granular cells, and forms an inconspicuous border to layer
III, which homogenously contains loosely packed smaller cells.
Layer IV is, in contrast to Ig1 and Ig2, small, cell sparse, and
shows intermingling pyramidal cells from lower layer III and
upper layer V. However, because it is nevertheless clearly
present, Id1 fulfills the criteria of a dysgranular area. Layer V
consists of larger, more densely packed pyramidal cells as
compared with layer III and can hardly be distinguished from


the adjacent layer VI which in turn trails off gradually into the
white matter. The GLI profile reflects the lower cell density of
this area—in particular its supragranular layers—and confirms
the less prominent appearance of layer IV compared with the
granular areas.

Macroanatomic Location and Cytoarchitectonic Borders
Both granular areas (Ig1 and Ig2) are located in the dorsal part
of the posterior insula and are bordered ventrally and anterior
by dysgranular insular cortex as summarized by the schematic
flat map provided in Figure 5d. All cortical borders were tested
for statistically significant changes of cytoarchitectonic features
using the Mahalanobis distance measure. We accepted only
significant maxima of the distance function as borders. Those
borders are characterized by well-localized changes in
cytoarchitecture, which can also be seen at low magnification
in the microscope, and are reflected by the corresponding
peaks of the Mahalanobis distance function (see Fig. 6). We did
not observe gradual changes in cytoarchitecture between the
mapped areas.
Area Ig1 is located in the dorsal part of the posterior long
gyrus, close to posterior end of the circular sulcus where it
borders the retroinsular cortex (see Fig. 7). It also has a common
border with parietal opercular area OP2 (see Eickhoff,
Schleicher, et al. 2006), which commonly extends onto the
dorsal part of insula and covers the superior circular sulcus in all


Figure 6. Borders between granular insular area Ig1 and the retroinsular cortex RI (a), as well as the parietal opercular area OP2 (b). RI differs from Ig1 by a lower cell density in
layers III and V and more prominent pyramidal cells in layer IIIc. The border between Ig1 and the opercular area OP2 is characterized by a decrease in cortical thickness and an
overall increase in cell density in OP2

layers of Ig2. In Ig2, prominent pyramidal cells in layer IIIc become visible, and the width of layer II decreases. The border between Ig2 and Id1 is characterized by a considerably
smaller and less conspicuous layer IV in Id1.


10 brains. Ig1 is followed ventrally by the dysgranular area Id1
and the temporal cortex and rostrally by area Ig2.
The dorsal border of area Ig2 is formed by the opercular
areas OP2 and OP3 (Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006; cf., Fig. 8).
It covers the dorsal part of the postcentral insular sulcus and
extends onto the postcentral gyrus but does not reach the
central sulcus of the insula. Ig2 is followed by area Id1 on its
temporal and 2 other dysgranular insular areas on its rostral
border (putative areas Id2 and Id3, see Fig. 8). Area Id1, finally,
is located mainly around the posterior part of the inferior
circular sulcus covering the posterior temporal insula. It
extends onto the supratemporal plane though it never reaches
Heschl’s gyrus. On the supratemporal plane it neighbors the
temporoinsular cortex (see Fig. 9). Dorsally, Id1 is neighbored
by Ig1 and Ig2, as well as the putative area Id2. The rostral
border is formed by an agranular area (see Fig. 9).

Intersubject Architectonic Variability and Volumetric
Analysis
We extracted cytoarchitectonic profiles from Ig1, Ig2, Id1, and
the adjacent agranular area Iag1 to investigate 1) if our
classification into ‘‘granular,’’ ‘‘dysgranular,’’ and ‘‘agranular’’ is
confirmed by quantitative analysis and 2) to test for interindividual, interareal, and gender differences. For investigating the
relation between the areas, we applied a cluster analysis, which
supported the proposed classification based on the granularity
criterion: The analysis revealed 2 clusters based on the RMSSTD
index (Sharma 1995). It was found that the granular areas lg1 and
lg2 were separated from the dysgranular area (see Fig. 10). The
intercluster Euclidean distance was 4.5 in the granular and 6.0 in
the other cluster. The intercluster distance was 8.20. The
additional assessment of architectonic differences by ANOVA
revealed no effect of the putative confounding variables age,
gender, and side on the dependent variables. However, the
interareal differences were significant (P < 0.01) confirming
that interareal differences can be established in spite of the
marked interindividual variability in cytoarchitecture. The areal
volumes calculated from the histological sections (see Table 2)


which we tested in a separate ANOVA, showed significant size
differences between subjects (f 941 = 5.5; P = 0.0001) indicating a difference in individual brain size. Moreover, they showed
significant size differences between the areas (f241 = 5.26;
P = 0.0093) reflecting different areal sizes. All other effects as of
sides (f 141 = 0.09; P = 0.77), interaction between area and side
(f 241 = 0.06; P = 0.94), interaction between gender and area
(f 241 = 1.25; P = 0.3), and interactions between gender, area, and
side (f241 = 0.13; P = 0.88) were not significant.

Probability Maps and MPMs
Probability maps were calculated for each area by superimposing the spatially normalized representations from the
different subjects. These maps reflect the probability of
observing a particular area at a specific location within the
MNI space (see Fig. 11) based on our sample of 10 subjects.
They describe the location, spatial extent, and interindividual
variability for each area in a standard reference system. Upon
examination of these probabilistic maps, it becomes evident
that high probabilities for the location of a specific area were
observed for 49--140 voxels (for an overlap of 9 of 10 brains).
Therefore, interindividual variability was low in comparison to
other cytoarchitectonic areas (Choi et al. 2006), especially as
the posterior insular areas are relatively small (which aggravates the effects of variability). At lower probabilities, the
probabilistic maps of Ig1, Ig2, Id1, and adjacent areas overlapped. A probability of 10% for a certain area at one specific
voxel indicates a probability of 90% for another area at this
location and vice versa. To assign the most likely area to every
voxel, an MPM of the posterior insula was computed.
This MPM represents a contiguous, nonoverlapping parceling
of this region (Fig. 12). It hence bears a close resemblance to
classical brain maps. Importantly, however, the MPM does not
show the parceling of an exemplary or ‘‘typical’’ hemisphere as do
previous architectonic brain maps (e.g. Brodmann 1909) but
reflects the most likely area at each position in a sample of 10
postmortem brains. This map again illustrates that all areas are
located posterior to the central sulcus of the insula and shows

that areas Ig1 and Ig2 do not reach the superior circular sulcus. A
comparison between the centers of gravity of the MPMs and
those of the individual brains revealed a good stereotactic
representation as all but one coordinate were located within
only one SD. The respective coordinates are given in Table 3.

Discussion

In this study, we reported the architectonic characteristics and
stereotaxic location of 3 cytoarchitectonic areas in the


posterior human insula as delineated by classical histological
criteria and a quantitative analysis (Schleicher et al. 2005). This
approach represents a considerable advancement over classical
histological studies (Brodmann 1909; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Bailey and von Bonin 1951) that relied purely
on visual inspection of a small sample of postmortem brains.
Based on our quantitative analysis, we could refine the classical
tripartition of the insular cortex into a granular, a dysgranular,
and an agranular part by identifying 2 granular (Ig1 and Ig2) and
1 dysgranular (Id1) area in the posterior insula alone

between sides. The 2 granular areas Ig1 and Ig2 are more similar than the
dysgranular and agranular areas.

It has to be mentioned that the classical tripartition was
mainly derived from nonhuman primate studies (Mesulam and
Mufson 1982). Although the segregation of the insula in
macaques and humans seems to be similar (Mesulam and


Mufson 1985), there are still architectonic and macroscopical
differences between the species, which become apparent
during early development. For example, the presence and
course of insular sulci in humans are different from new world
monkeys having an entirely smooth insular cortex, as well as
from old world monkeys, which only have a single orbitoinsular
groove (Shelley and Trimble 2004). Such differences, therefore,
make a straightforward extrapolation problematic.
During development, the insular lobe does not grow as fast as
the surrounding structures, which form the temporal, parietal,
and frontal opercula covering the insula during late fetal stages.
At about 13--17 weeks, the limiting sulci start to demarcate and
distinguish the insular region from the rest of the cerebral
cortex. Between the 20th and 22nd week, the insular sulci
begin to demarcate and at the time of birth the sulcal pattern

et al. 2007).
Although a multitude of functions has been ascribed to the
insula, there is evidence for a functional segregation between at
least the anterior and posterior insula. Olfactory, gustatory, and
emotional stimuli have been described to elicit activations in
the anterior insula (Poellinger et al. 2001; Kringelbach et al.
2004; Small and Prescott 2005; Frith and Singer 2008; Singer
and Lamm 2009). This is in accordance with connectivity
studies in nonhuman primates that indicate a dense connection
between the anterior insula and the amygdala, the perirhinal
and the entorhinal cortex, and parts of the prefrontal lobe
(Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Augustine 1996). In contrast, the
posterior insula seems to be connected to primary and
secondary somatosensory areas and the supplementary motor
area (SMA). In humans, these areas have been found to be
involved in sensorimotor tasks.

Previous Cytoarchitectonic Maps
Earlier maps divided the insular cortex into a granular posterior
and an agranular anterior part (Brodmann 1909) or additionally
introduced a precentral dysgranular region (von Economo and
Koskinas 1925). One map (Bailey and von Bonin 1951) is
particularly interesting as it distinguishes 3 individual areas in
the human insula while at the same time both parietal and
temporal lobe were conceptualized as a homogenous region


-----

Upon closer inspection, however, it becomes apparent that
they labeled the posterior insula as a continuation of parietal
and temporal regions. A very detailed map (Rose 1928) reports
multiple areas in the human insula distinguished primarily by
their granularity. A synopsis of these classical brain maps clearly
shows that all authors separated the human insula into
a granular posterior and an agranular anterior region. The
additional delineation of an intermediate dysgranular part, as
well as the exact location of the borders between these
regions, however, varies widely between different maps.
In more recent maps, which describe the insula of
nonhuman primates (Mesulam and Mufson 1982) and subsequently of man (Mesulam and Mufson 1985), the concept of
granularity was explicitly introduced to subdivide the insular
lobe into 3 belt-like regions. In both humans and nonhuman
primates, a circular organization of the insular cortex
surrounding its allocortical pole was proposed. The inner
agranular belt is surrounded by a dysgranular zone, which is
then followed by a granular part covering the dorsal posterior
insula. This map hence not only corresponds to classical
mapping approaches by describing a granular posterior insula
and—in accordance to a highly detailed map (Rose 1928)—a
posterior--ventral dysgranular region but also additionally
pinpoints the main criterion used by previous examiners
introducing the concept of belts of different degrees of
granularity.
Our own data on the cytoarchitecture of the human
posterior insula are in accordance with classical maps. It
demonstrates the existence of granular cortical areas in the
posterior--dorsal insula. Moreover, according to detailed earlier
maps (Rose 1928; Mesulam and Mufson 1985), we could
identify a dysgranular cortex adjoining the granular zone on its
anterior and ventral border. Beyond these commonalities, the
cytoarchitectonic map presented here enlarges the current
view of the human insula as it demonstrates the presence of
several distinct subregions within the granular and dysgranular
zones. These subdivisions of the granular and dysgranular region
may have important implications for understanding the role of the
human insula as it can be expected that different cytoarchitectonic entitiesalsosustain differentfunctionalcapacities. The heredescribed feature of granularity is the most conspicuous and
regularly reported difference between insular areas.

Functional Roles of the Posterior Insula
Activations in the insula have been reported for virtually all
cognitive, affective, and sensory paradigms tested in functional
imaging studies and have also been implicated by research in
nonhuman primates. However, the most reliable evidence of an
involvement of the posterior insula has been received for
studies investigating painful, somatosensory, auditory, and
interoceptive stimuli, as well as motor paradigms. For these
functions, a variety of functional imaging, electrophysiological,
and connectivity studies are available in humans and nonhuman
primates. We will therefore focus on these functions and their
relationship to the posterior insula.

Activation by Somatosensory Stimuli
In nonhuman primates, the posterior insula was shown to have
direct connections to somatosensory areas and was thus
assigned to be a higher level component of the somatosensory
system (Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Friedman et al. 1986;
Augustine 1996) In particular this region was reported to be


reciprocally connected with the neighboring secondary somatosensory cortex (SII) and to receive projections from the
primary somatosensory cortex (in particular areas 3b, 1, and 2)
and somatosensory association areas 5 (PE) and 7b (PF)
(Mufson and Mesulam 1982; Mesulam and Mufson 1985;
Friedman et al. 1986). Efferents were described to reach
amygdala, frontal cortex, perirhinal cortex, and hippocampus
(Friedman et al. 1986; Augustine 1996). Along with these
findings, this region was interpreted to play a role in tactile
memory or emotion-related processing (Mesulam and Mufson
1985; Augustine 1996; Dijkerman and de Haan 2007).
Single-unit recording studies in monkeys consequently
reported responses to somatosensory activation in the dorsal
posterior insula (Robinson and Burton 1980; Schneider et al.
1993; Zhang et al. 1999; Coq et al. 2004). However, not a mere
somatosensory representation but rather multisensory processing was observed as different recording sites responded to
auditory, baroreceptive, or painful stimuli (Zhang et al. 1999;
Coq et al. 2004). The recordings thus did not only support the
theory of the posterior insula as a somatosensory association
region but also indicated that it might play a more multisensory
and hence most likely integrative role.
In humans, somatosensory activation of the posterior insular
cortex was shown by direct intracerebral stimulation in patients
undergoing surgery for temporal lobe epilepsy (Ostrowsky et al.
2002), as well as by functional imaging studies. These studies
investigated simple stimulation paradigms, as well as more
complex tasks like rating the roughness of gratings or tactile
object recognition (Gelnar et al. 1998; Deuchert et al. 2002; Reed
et al. 2004; Kitada et al. 2005). Regarding the results from
connectivity and single-cell studies, these results corroborate
a role of the posterior insula in somatosensory processing.

Activation by Pain
Connectivity studies in monkeys reported the posterior insula
to be a part of the pain network consisting of the primary and
secondary somatosensory areas, anterior cingulate cortex,
prefrontal cortex, and the amygdala (for review, see Peyron
et al. 2000; Chen 2007). In particular, afferent connections
were reported to reach the insula from primary and secondary
somatosensory cortices (Friedman et al. 1986; Augustine 1996),
as well as from pain-specific parts of the thalamus (Craig et al.
1994). Efferents were reported to reach amygdala and prefrontal cortex (Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Augustine 1996), as
well as the cingulum (Mesulam and Mufson 1985). In line with
these findings, functional recordings in monkeys directly
demonstrated the involvement of the insular cortex in pain
processing (Baumga¨ rtner et al. 1998). This study demonstrated
that laser-evoked noxious potentials could be recorded from
the posterior insular cortex in anesthetized monkeys. Extracellular single-unit recordings (Zhang et al. 1999) reported
responses to painful stimuli in the middle and anterior insula
close to touch and baroreceptive responsive units. Again, this
points to an integrative processing in the insula.
Functional imaging and electrophysiological studies in
humans also have repeatedly demonstrated the responsiveness
of the insula to painful stimulation (Peyron et al. 2000, 2002;
Treede et al. 2000; Frot and Mauguiere 2003; Alkire et al. 2004;
Brooks et al. 2005; Chen 2007). However, the exact location of
pain-related activity in the insular cortex varies between
studies as some authors report a focus of activation posterior
(Craig et al 1994; Alkire et al 2004) whereas others describe it


-----

rather in the mid-insula (Treede et al. 2000; Peyron et al. 2002;
Brooks et al. 2005; Chen 2007) in addition to a well-established
operculoinsular activation site (Peyron et al. 2000; Chen 2007).
Due to the close spatial proximity in this region, a relation of
this site to a defined anatomic structure is difficult (Farrell et al.
2005). However, as well for the opercular region OP1 (Frot
et al. 2001; Eickhoff, Amunts, et al. 2006) as for the posterior
insula (Frot et al. 2007), a role in pain processing has already
been demonstrated. Further investigation in this region will
therefore require a careful differentiation of insular and
opercular activations, as previously demonstrated by fMRI
(Alkire et al. 2004) and electrophysiological methods (Frot and
Mauguiere 2003; Frot et al. 2007). This is even more important
as the above-discussed posterior insular activation in somatosensory paradigms seems to contradict a described nonsomatosensory role in pain intensity rating (Frot et al. 2007).
The cytoarchitectonic maps presented here may provide an
effective means for addressing these issues by enabling a direct
comparison of somatosensory and painful stimuli, respectively,
with the differentiated cytoarchitectonic organization of
opercular and insular areas.

Motor Activation
Connections between the posterior insula and the frontal
motor areas have also been demonstrated in nonhuman
primates. In particular, invasive tracing techniques revealed
projections of the granular insula toward SMA proper and
afferent connections reaching the dysgranular insula from the
pre-SMA (Luppino et al. 1993; Augustine 1996).
Those findings are in accordance with the observation that
movement may be elicited by electrical stimulation of the
posterior insula in humans (Showers and Lauer 1961), which
also underlines the functional relevance of these connections
to movement production. Functional imaging studies revealed
increased motor activation during the attention condition in
the posterior insular cortex (Johansen-Berg and Matthews
2002), as well as a role in sensorimotor integration (Ciccarelli
et al. 2005). With regard to a discussed role of this region in
sensory learning (Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Augustine 1996;
Dijkerman and de Haan 2007), it might relay relevant sensory
feedback to motor areas. This would be in accordance with
different studies in patients, which showed role of this region
in motor recovery after stroke in humans (Chollet et al. 1991;
Carey et al. 2005; Loubinoux et al. 2007).

Activation by Interoception
Studies in monkey brains report insular connections to the
hypothalamus (Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Craig 2002) and to
thalamic nuclei that are known to relay information from the
autonomic nervous system. It was suggested that these
connections indicate a role of the insula in interoception
(Craig 2002). Single-cell studies in macaques support this
hypothesis because responses (slightly lateralized to the right)
to changes in blood pressure were recorded (Zhang et al.
1999). Interestingly, right insular strokes result in a higher risk
of cardiac complications (Colivicchi et al. 2004). A sympathetic
dominance in the right and parasympathetic dominance in the
left insula have been reported (Oppenheimer 2006).
Functional imaging studies describe insular activation in
breath holding (McKay et al. 2008), viscerosensory processing
(Aziz et al. 2000), as well as a role in cardiovascular regulation
(Oppenheimer 2006) In epileptic patients insular seizures


show both visceral and respiratory manifestations (Guenot and
Isnard 2008). However, as baroreceptive response units in
monkeys were found in the mid-insula rather than the
posterior insula (Zhang et al. 1999), interoception is probably
a function for more anterior parts of the insula and not for the
posterior part mapped in the present observations.

Auditory Activation
Connectivity studies in monkeys implicate an involvement of
the posterior insula in auditory processing. Direct connections
from the medial geniculate body were reported to reach the
granular and to a lesser extent also the dysgranular insular
regions (Burton and Jones 1976). Furthermore, direct connections between posterior insula and auditory cortex were
described (Mesulam and Mufson 1985; Smiley et al. 2007).
Single-cell recordings in monkeys go well with these findings as
they revealed that posterior insular neurons responded directly
to auditory stimuli (Bieser and Muller-Preuss 1996; Bieser
1998), though a close spatial proximity to somatosensory
stimuli was described (Coq et al. 2004).
These results are corresponding to reports that show the
human insula to be involved ‘‘in several key auditory processes’’
(for review, see Bamiou et al. 2003) and hypothesized it to
participate in sensory as well as integrating aspects of auditory
processing. Summed up, a more integrative function in this area
can be assumed for auditory functions as well. However, the
degree of integration and differentiation of functions has still to
be investigated.

Conclusions

Using an observer-independent approach, we could identify 3
distinct cytoarchitectonic areas in the human posterior insula.
Although this new scheme does not contradict previous
classification of the insular cortex based on its granularity, it
further develops these maps by demonstrating the existence of
several individual areas within these major zones. Given the
variety of functions ascribed to the (posterior) insula based on
functional imaging studies and investigations of connectivity, it
seems reasonable that these subdivisions form the anatomical
substrate of a diversified mosaic of structurally and functionally
distinct areas in the human posterior insula. As probabilistic
maps of each area have been computed in standard MNI space,
this hypothesis can now be rigorously tested by comparing
anatomical and functional data. This was not possible on the
basis of the previous schematic maps. Such integration of
structural and functional information will allow a further
characterization of the segregation and integration of different
modalities (Zilles and Amunts 2009) within this region. To
support the usage of our anatomical data for this purpose, the
probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of areas Ig1, Ig2, and Id1
