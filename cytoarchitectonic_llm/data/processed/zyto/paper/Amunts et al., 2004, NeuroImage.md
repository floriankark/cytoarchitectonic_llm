We investigated neural activations underlying a verbal fluency task
and cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps of Broca’s speech region
(Brodmann’s areas 44 and 45). To do so, we reanalyzed data from a
previous functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) [Brain 125
(2002) 1024] and from a cytoarchitectonic study [J. Comp. Neurol. 412
(1999) 319] and developed a method to combine both data sets. In the
fMRI experiment, verbal fluency was investigated in 11 healthy
volunteers, who covertly produced words from predefined categories.
A factorial design was used with factors verbal class (semantic vs.
overlearned fluency) and switching between categories (no vs. yes).
fMRI data analysis employed SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Mapping). Cytoarchitectonic maps of areas 44 and 45 were derived from
histologic sections of 10 postmortem brains. Both the in vivo fMRI and
postmortem MR data were warped to a common reference brain using
a new elastic warping tool. Cytoarchitectonic probability maps with
stereotaxic information about intersubject variability were calculated
for both areas and superimposed on the functional data, which showed
the involvement of left hemisphere areas with verbal fluency relative to
the baseline. Semantic relative to overlearned fluency showed greater
involvement of left area 45 than of 44. Thus, although both areas
participate in verbal fluency, they do so differentially. Left area 45 is
more involved in semantic aspects of language processing, while area
44 is probably involved in high-level aspects of programming speech
production per se. The combination of functional data analysis with a
new elastic warping tool and cytoarchitectonic maps opens new
perspectives for analyzing the cortical networks involved in language.

Introduction

Broca first conjectured that the posterior part of the left inferior
frontal gyrus was crucially implicated in the production of ‘‘articulate language’’ (Broca, 1861). This conclusion was based on both
clinical and neuropathologic, macroscopic examination of an
aphasic patient who became known as ‘‘Tan Tan’’ (Signoret et
al., 1984). The behavioral syndrome described has subsequently
been called ‘‘Broca’s aphasia’’. Tan Tans’s lesion involved the
posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus where the opercular and
triangular parts are found (Duvernoy, 1991). Broca did not analyze
Tan Tan’s brain or those of his subsequent patients with respect to
microstructure and also refrained from relating lesions to cortical
areas. Considering the location of the lesions in these historical
brains (Castaigne, 1979; Signoret et al., 1984), it has been
hypothesized that Brodmann (1909) areas (BA) 44 and 45 are
the cytoarchitectonic correlates of Broca’s region (Aboitiz and
Garcia, 1997; Uylings et al., 1999).
Recent functional imaging techniques allow the neural substrate of language to be investigated in healthy subjects (for an
overview, see Bookheimer, 2002). For example, verbal fluency, in
the sense of producing a series of words from a predefined
category, a task which is often impaired in Broca’s aphasia (e.g.,
Goodglass et al., 1967) and which may involve functional
distinctions such as different grammatical classes (Caramazza,
2000), has frequently been analyzed with both positron emission
tomography (PET) and functional magnetic resonance imaging
(fMRI) (Audenaert et al., 2000; Ravnkilde et al., 2002; Schlosser
et al., 2002). More specific aspects of language perception and
production such as phonologic and syntactic processing (BenShachar et al., 2003; Clahsen and Featherstone, 1999; Featherstone et al., 2000; Friederici et al., 2003; Groß et al., 1998;
Indefrey et al., 2001; Keller et al., 2001; Kno¨sche et al., 2000;
Mecklinger et al., 1995) have also been explored using functional
imaging. Such studies increased our knowledge of neurolinguistic
aspects of language processing. They do not, however, answer the


-----

question which cortical areas participate in the various aspects of
language processing.
There is, at present, no way to analyze function and microstructure in one and the same human brain, although some very recent,
high-resolution MR studies with a spatial resolution at almost
microscopic level are promising in that respect (Barbier et al.,
2002; Fatterpekar et al., 2002; Walters et al., 2003). At present, the
anatomical interpretation of functional activations is typically based
on the atlas system of Talairach and Tournoux (1988), which uses
Brodmann’s schematic surface drawings of an architectonic map
(Brodmann, 1909) as the basis for an architectonic parcellation.
Thus, Brodmann’s areas were simply transferred to the atlas brain
by trying to identify corresponding sulcal patterns in both brains,
assuming a strong association between the sulcal pattern and the
borders of the cortical areas. Such an association, however, was
already doubted by Brodmann himself. He mentioned that ‘‘. . .a
schematic drawing can reflect only the major spatial relationships,
and therefore, precise topographic associations cannot be considered in general or only in a distorted manner; this is true in particular
for all those cortical regions which have borders in the neighborhood of sulci and those regions which are located in the depths of
such a cortical region’’ (translated from Brodmann, 1908).
We have previously been able to confirm that this statement is
true for the vast majority of cytoarchitectonic areas, for example, of
the parietal lobe, motor, visual and temporal cortex (for overviews,
see Amunts et al., 2002; Zilles et al., 2002a,b), and for BA 44 and
45 in particular (Amunts et al., 1999). Although both areas always
occupy the posterior part of the inferior frontal gyrus, the precise
locations of their borders vary considerably. For example, BA 44
occupies in most of the cases the opercular part, but can also
encroach on the triangular part. BA 45 is located at the triangular
part, but may also reach aspects of the opercular part. BA 44 may
border BA 6 in the anterior or in the posterior bank of the fundus of
the precentral sulcus (Amunts et al., 1999). BA 45 may occupy parts
of the middle frontal gyrus (Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995).
In addition to the variability of areal borders with respect to sulci,
there also exists a large intersubject variability of the sulcal pattern
of the frontal lobe itself (Ono et al., 1990; Tomaiuolo et al., 1999).
To overcome these problems, cytoarchitectonic probability
maps of BA 44 and 45 (Amunts et al., 1999) have been developed
for structural–functional analysis of language (Horwitz et al.,
2003; Indefrey et al., 2001). Such analysis, however, is dependent
on the precision of the localization of functional activations with
respect to the cytoarchitectonic parcellation of the cerebral cortex.
At least two methodologic aspects are crucial in this context: (i) the
application of a common reference brain for both the fMRI in vivo
and the postmortem cytoarchitectonic data, and (ii) a uniform
warping approach to the common reference brain of all data
modalities irrespective of the different quality and spatial resolution [in vivo, functional echo planar imaging (EPI), and structural
anatomical, as well as postmortem, cytoarchitectonic data].
The aim of this combined anatomical and fMRI study was to
test the hypothesis that cytoarchitectonically-defined BA 44 and 45
of the left hemisphere are involved differentially in a verbal
fluency task in healthy volunteers. To test this hypothesis, we
combined and reanalyzed data from a previous fMRI study of
verbal fluency (Gurd et al., 2002) and of the cytoarchitecture of BA
44 and 45 (Amunts et al., 1999). To answer the neuroscientific
question, we approached the methodologic problems outlined
above by developing and applying a method for the integration
of fMRI data analyzed using SPM99 (Statistical Parametric Map

ping) with a non-SPM, elastic warping algorithm, and probabilistic
cytoarchitectonic maps. The present study, thus, not only combines
fMRI data with probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps, but also
presents a new methodologic approach to analyzing the relationship of cortical microstructure and cerebral function.

Material and methods

Cytoarchitectonic mapping of BA 44 and 45

Mapping was performed in cell-body stained (Merker, 1983),
serial histologic sections of 10 human brains (5 males, 5 females;
age range from 37 to 85 years; mean age = 66 years, SD = 14
years). All brains were obtained from body donor programs in
accordance with the ethics committee of the University of Du¨sseldorf. The autopsies were performed within 8 to 24 h after death.
Handedness and language dominance of the subjects were not
known. Considering an incidence of about 95% of left-sided
language dominance (Branche et al., 1964), it is likely that most
of our cases were dominant for the left side. Brains were fixed in
4% formalin (cases nos. 2–8) or in Bodian, a mixture of formalin,
glacial acetic acid, and ethanol (remaining cases). MR imaging of
the fixed brains was carried out with a Siemens 1.5 T magnet
(Erlangen, Germany), with a T1-weighted three-dimensional (3-D)
FLASH sequence covering the entire brain (flip angle, 40j;
repetition time of TR = 40 ms; echo time of TE = 5 ms for each
image). Each volume consists 128 sagittal sections. The spatial
resolution was 1 � 1 � 1.17 mm, each voxel with a resolution of
8 bits corresponding to 256 gray values.
The brains were embedded in paraffin and sectioned in the
coronal plane through both hemispheres. Per brain, 6000–7500
sections (20 Am) were acquired. Each 15th section was mounted on
glass slides and silver-stained for perikarya (Merker, 1983). Each
60th section of the entire series was used for further analysis of
cytoarchitecture. Images of these histologic sections were digitized
and three-dimensionally reconstructed.
Accordingly, each brain was represented by three data sets: (i)
the histologic data set with high contrast, but distortions caused by
histologic techniques (images of histologic, silver-stained sections
were digitized with a CCD camera), (ii) a photo-data set with low
contrast (resulting from the unstained surface of the paraffin block)
showing the histologic section before sectioning, together with a
reference system to establish the 3-D integrity of the histologic
volume, and (iii) the structural MR-data set which was obtained
before paraffin-embedding with improved contrast but at a different orientation than the photo-data set (Schormann et al., 1995).
The comparison of these three data sets allowed us to correct for
deformations and shrinkage inevitably caused by histologic techniques, for example, embedding, sectioning, and mounting on
glass slides. Both linear and nonlinear transformations were
applied (Henn et al., 1997; Mohlberg et al., 2003; Schormann
and Zilles, 1998).
To account for intersubject variability in brain macroscopy,
brains were warped to the standard format of the ECHBD
(European Computerized Human Brain Data Base) reference
brain (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1998) using a combination of
an affine transformation (only shifting, scaling, and rotating), a
normalization of grey levels, and subsequent nonlinear, elastic
transformation (Henn et al., 1997; Mohlberg et al., 2002; Schormann and Zilles, 1998). A vector field u was calculated for each

data set which described the transformation of each voxel of the
transformed brain (value and direction) to the reference brain (for
more details of the transformation, see below). The final orientation of the brains was in the plane determined by the anterior–
posterior commissures, that is, the AC–PC plane. The final
resolution of both the reference brain and the postmortem brains
was 1 � 1 � 1 mm.
Cytoarchitectonic borders of BA 44 and 45 (Fig. 1) were
defined using an observer-independent approach for the definition

Fig. 1. Cytoarchitecture of BA 44 and 45 in coronal, cell-body stained
sections of a postmortem brain. The cytoarchitecture of both areas is
characterized by large pyramidal cells in deep layer III, which exceed those
of layer V in size. Whereas granular BA 45 shows a clearly visible layer IV,
the layer IV of the dysgranular BA 44 is thinner and not clearly delineable
from neighboring layers, since pyramidal cells from layers III and V invade
into layer IV. Cortical layers are numbered. Scale bars, 0.5 mm.


of areal borders (Amunts et al., 1999; Schleicher et al., 1999;
Zilles et al., 2002b). This approach is based on (i) the measurement of the grey level index (GLI; Schleicher and Zilles, 1990)
as an estimate of the volume fraction of nerve cell bodies (Wree
et al., 1982), (ii) the calculation of profiles which quantify the
laminar changes in the volume fraction from the cortical surface
to the white matter, that is, the cytoarchitecture, and which cover
in small equidistant intervals the putative border regions of the
cytoarchitectonic areas, (iii) the extraction of features from the
profiles as numerical descriptors of the cytoarchitecture, (iv) the
calculation of the Mahalanobis distances as measures of differences in shape between profiles coming from different areas, (v)
the definition of areal borders at those locations at which the
Mahalanobis distances show significant values, thus indicating
that the shape of the profile, that is, the cytoarchitecture, has
changed abruptly.
Areal borders were then transferred to digitized histologic
sections and three-dimensionally reconstructed (Fig. 2). The
reconstructions of the two areas in the postmortem brains showed
that both areas occupied the posterior part of the inferior frontal
gyrus in each brain (Fig. 2). They also revealed a considerable
intersubject variability, which can be characterized in three
different ways: (i) the shape and the extent of both areas on
the free cortical surface was variable. Compare, for example, the
appearance of BA 44 in the right hemisphere of brain no. 7 with
that of the right BA 44 of brain no. 1 and the left BA 44 of brain
no. 3; (ii) the relationship of the cytoarchitectonically defined
borders with respect to surrounding sulci was clearly variable.
For example, whereas the diagonal sulcus marked the border
between BA 44 and 45 in the right hemisphere of brain no. 3,
this sulcus was inside of BA 44 in left brain no. 8, and it was
completely absent in brain no.10; and (iii) brain macroscopy (i.e.,
the shape and presence of the sulci) was also variable. For
example, the diagonal sulcus was present in only every second
hemisphere.
The individual cytoarchitectonic maps of BA 44 and 45 were
then warped to the standard reference brain using the vector field u
as calculated for the transformation of the individual postmortem
brains. Centers of gravity of the maps and the extent in all spatial
directions were calculated for each area of each postmortem brain
and averaged over the whole sample size (Tables 1 and 2). Finally,
the cytoarchitectonic maps were superimposed upon the reference
brain. Color-coded ‘‘probability maps’’ were calculated which
showed, for each voxel of the reference brain, the number of
brains in which the cytoarchitectonically defined areas overlapped
(Fig. 3). Such a probability map represents a measure of intersubject variability in the size and location of the respective
cytoarchitectonic area under the assumptions that the intersubject
variability in the sulcal and gyral pattern of the brain has been
eliminated after applying the elastic warping procedure, and that
the influence of the warping itself can be neglected.

Functional imaging of verbal fluency

fMRI of verbal fluency (Gurd et al., 2002) was performed in 11
right-handed healthy volunteers (6 male, 5 female; mean age: 32
years, SD = 4 years) with no history of neurologic or psychiatric
disease. The investigation was approved by the ethics committee of
the Heinrich Heine University of Du¨sseldorf. Informed consent
was obtained before MR imaging. In contrast to the previous study
(Gurd et al., 2002), (i) we here focus on verbal fluency (and not

switching), and (ii) we reanalyze the data to allow for a topographic interpretation of the functional activations on the basis of
probabilistic maps of BA 44 and 45 (rather than anatomical
landmarks, i.e., gyri and sulci). We, therefore, provide a quantitative measure for the involvement of these two cortical areas in
verbal fluency. This reanalysis, extension and new approach,
involves the application of a different normalization procedure
(warping) and a different reference brain for the MR data. Furthermore, we use a different statistical approach for analyzing the
functional activations based on the focus on BA 44 and 45 [‘‘ROI
(region of interest) analysis’’], which are the areas of interest with
respect to the neuroscientific question under investigation.
The design of the fMRI study was, in short, as follows: subjects
were asked to covertly produce words with their eyes closed. In the
nonswitching trials of this verbal fluency task, subjects responded
with a series of items from a prespecified semantic category
(‘‘semantic’’; e.g., flowers or furniture) or from overlearned
sequences (‘‘overlearned’’; e.g., months of the year or days of
the week). The contrast between these two verbal fluency tasks
enabled us to image brain regions implicated in the task with the
greater semantic search requirements. In the switching conditions,
subjects produced words alternately from three semantic categories
(e.g., fruits, cars, or furniture) or from three overlearned sequences
(e.g., days of the week, months, or letters of the alphabet). The
comparison of these switching trials with the single, no-switching
trials should isolate those regions implicated in switching between
verbal categories. The latter condition is not of primary relevance
for the purpose of the current study. The design of the experiment
was thus factorial—factor 1 was verbal category (semantic vs.
overlearned); factor 2 was switching, that is, single specification
fluency was compared with alternating specification fluency
(switching vs. nonswitching).
All subjects were pretrained on all these types of verbal fluency
tasks to ensure that the experimental results reflect task performance per se, rather than the effects of learning novel tasks.
Training was performed both several days before scanning and a
day before scanning. For more details of the training, see Gurd et
al. (2002). Immediately before scanning, subjects received a final
training session with overt task performance recorded on tape to
assess task performance.
MRI was performed on a Magnetom Vision 1.5 Tesla scanner.
Anatomical T1-weighted images covering the whole brain were
obtained using a high-resolution MP-RAGE pulse sequence [repetition time (TR) = 11.4 ms; echo time (TE) = 4.4 ms; flip angle =
15j; field of view = 230 mm; matrix size = 200 � 256; 128 sagittal
slices with 1.25-mm slice thickness]. EPI was performed with a
gradient booster system. Pulse sequence parameters were as


follows: gradient echo EPI, TE = 66 ms; TR = 5 s; 32 slices with
4.0-mm slice thickness; interslice gap = 0.3 mm. The blocked
design fMRI paradigm comprised eight repetitions of a 45-s
baseline state and a 30-s activation state (two repeats of each of
the four experimental conditions). The baseline consisted 30 s (6
images) without presentation of auditory task instructions and 15 s
(3 images) with presentation of auditory task instructions. During
the activation state, six whole-brain images were acquired. Each
volunteer performed all five runs, whereby each run comprised the
eight blocks mentioned above during the complete measurement
procedure.

Image processing

Statistical analysis and image processing were performed on
SPARC Ultra 10 workstations (SUN Microsystems Computers,
Palo Alto, USA) using MATLAB (The Mathworks Inc., Natick,
USA), the MPItool (MPItool, MPI for Neurological Research,
Cologne, Germany), and Statistical Parametric Mapping software
(SPM99, Wellcome Department of Cognitive Neurology, UK;
http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk). The MPItool was applied for data
transformation into SPM (analyze format). SPM99 was used for
coregistration of the EPI images to their anatomical images,
smoothing, and creation of statistical maps of significant relative
regional BOLD (blood oxygenation level dependent) response
changes (Friston et al., 1995a,b). The 120 volume images of each
time series were automatically realigned to the first image to
correct for head movement between scans. Image sets of the four
conditions and the baseline were then coregistered to the 3-D
anatomical data set using SPM.
We applied a non-SPM elastic warping algorithm to enable the
transformation of (i) the postmortem data, (ii) the anatomical MR
data, and (iii) the EPI data of the verbal fluency task to a non-SPM
reference (ECHBD) brain (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1998). Data
were thereafter expressed in terms of standard stereotaxic coordinates in the x-, y-, and z-axes. The application of a non-SPM
warping algorithm required the export of the anatomical 3-D and
EPI data from SPM, and the transformation of these data into the
space of ECHBD reference brain. The non-SPM warping algorithm
was used to allow for the preservation of the details of the anatomy
of the brains as a necessary condition for warping anatomical data
sets to an individual reference brain.
The anatomical 3-D brain data of each subject were interactively separated from surrounding tissue (e.g., meninges and
cerebrospinal fluid). This careful segmentation was an important
prerequisite for a precise warping to the reference brain (Henn et

Warping was done by using a volumetric deformation process D
which is based on maximizing locally the image similarity between


a template T and a reference data set R (i.e., the individual ECHBD

Navier-Lame´, smoothness constraints between T and R are simultaneously satisfied:

The physical properties of the elastic model and therefore the
quality of the deformation process can be appropriately controlled


through the constants c, l, and a. The latter partial differential
equation consisting approximately 36 million (number of voxels
multiplied by the number of dimensions) unknowns cannot be
calculated analytically. Therefore, we used a numerical approach
that determined the solution by an iterative algorithm. To reduce
the computational burden, an optimized full-multigrid method
was implemented. Three different scales were used in this study,
corresponding to the original image resolution (high), a subsampled version by a factor 2 (middle), and a subsampled version
by a factor 4 (low). The transformation vector field using an
ordinary iterative numerical algorithm for solving large equation
systems was calculated for each resolution. The results obtained
in low resolution were up-sampled and linearly interpolated to the
next higher spatial resolution. The up-sampled transformation
vector field was then used as the initialization for the studied
resolution. The calculation of a precise warp of a single subject
brain of 256 � 256 � 256 voxels on a Linux PC with a 1 GHz
Intel Pentium CPU, resulting in a deformation field u that
transforms each voxel of the anatomical scan to its corresponding
reference brain voxel, takes about 3.5 h, whereby an extremely
high accuracy in superposition of different individuals was
achieved (Fig. 4).
The EPI images were spatially normalized to the standard
reference brain by using the corresponding vector field u, reduced

in neural activity are shown as through-projections onto representations of the standard reference brain (Roland and Zilles, 1994). For the calculation of these
increases, anatomical MR data sets and EPI data were both warped to this standard reference brain using a novel nonlinear, elastic warping algorithm
(Mohlberg et al., 2002) which is based on a movement model for large deformations and a full multigrid procedure (Henn et al., 1997; Schormann and Zilles,
1998). The exact coordinates of the local maxima (identified by numbers) within the areas of activation and their Z statistics are given in Table 4. The
topographical relationship of the local maxima with respect to cytoarchitectonic areas BA 44 and 45 is shown in Fig. 6. L, R denote left and right hemispheres,
respectively.

Statistical analysis of fMRI data

Statistical analysis was performed using a random effects
model, modeling the different conditions as reference waveforms.
Repeated measures (scans) were collapsed within subject to give
one scan per condition per subject. These conditions were then
compared between subjects, thereby effecting a random effects
model. Specific effects were tested by applying appropriate linear
contrasts to the parameter estimates for each condition, resulting
in a t statistic for each voxel (Friston et al., 1995b). These t
statistics constitute a statistical parametric map which was then
interpreted by referring to the probabilistic behavior of Gaussian
random fields as described by Worsley et al. (1996). For an
orientating whole-brain analysis, voxels were identified as significant if they passed a height threshold of T = 5.09 ( P < 0.05,
corrected for whole-brain volume) and belonged to a cluster of at
least 20 activated voxels. All significant activations are reported
in Table 3 for data comparison. Z values are provided to enable
comparison with other studies.
As the aim of this study was to examine the involvement of
BA 44 and 45 in verbal fluency, the further analysis was
restricted to anatomically defined ROIs. These ROIs were defined
(separately for the left and right hemispheres) by the combined
extent of the unthresholded cytoarchitectonically derived probability maps of BA 44 and 45. For a given number of resels (i.e.,
resolution elements), a height threshold for the SPM{T} map can
be determined, which equals a P level of less than 0.05, corrected
for multiple comparisons in the search volume. For the left
hemispheric ROI, this height threshold was 3.77. For the right
hemispheric ROI, T = 3.72. No extent threshold was applied for
the ROI analyses.
Data were analyzed with respect to the main effects of verbal
class (semantic vs. overlearned fluency) and switching (yes vs.
no). A masking procedure was employed to ensure not only that
the activations of experimental interest were positive with respect
to the other experimental conditions, but also that they were
positive with respect of the low-level baseline. Accordingly,
(semantic > overlearned) and (overlearned > semantic) were
masked with (semantic > baseline) and (overlearned > baseline),
respectively.


Finally, the locations of the regions activated were compared
with the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps of BA 44 and 45
(Fig. 6). For visualization, the probability maps of BA 44 and 45
were thresholded at 50%; that is, only those voxels are shown,
which belong to the respective area in 5 or more out of the 10
brains. These volumes represent the ‘‘core’’ of the respective
areas.

Results

Cytoarchitectonic mapping of BA 44 and 45

Table 1 shows the stereotaxic coordinates of BA 44 and 45 as
obtained by the observer-independent analysis of cytoarchitectonic
borders in coronal, cell-body stained sections of 10 human postmortem brains (Amunts et al., 1999). The coordinates show a
larger mediolateral, ventrodorsal, and rostrocaudal extent of both
left areas than those reported in the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux
(1988) (Table 2). Differences between the two maps range from 7
mm (rostrocaudal extent of left BA 45) to 23 mm (mediolateral
extent of left BA 44). The individual location and extent of both
areas in the postmortem brains were highly variable as demonstrated by the probability maps (Fig. 3).

Neural activations

The whole-brain analysis of the comparison of verbal fluency
against low-level baseline (all conditions vs. rest) resulted in
bilateral activations of the posterior part of the frontal cortex,
including the frontal gyrus, precentral gyrus, parietal lobe, the
orbitofrontal gyrus/insula, as well as the cerebellum with more
extensive activations on the left than on the right (Table 3).
The ROI analysis showed activations of the left inferior frontal
gyrus which included both BA 44 and 45 (Fig. 6); 65% of BA 44

and 56% of BA 45 were activated (both maps thresholded at 5/10
brains). The corresponding local maximum showed a probability of
60% of lying in BA 45 and of only 20% of lying in BA 44; it was
located at x = �42, y = 26, z = 22 (T = 7.6). A large cluster of
activation was found in the right hemispheric ROI. One of the local
maxima of this activation was located at x = 40, y = 24, z = 6 (T =
6.5). It showed a probability of 20% of lying in BA 45. The other


local maxima showed a lower probability of lying in either BA 45
or 44. In addition, smaller clusters of activations showed a
probability of no more than 10% of lying in either BA 44 or 45.

Bilateral activations were observed in the anterior cingulate
cortex, the orbital part of the inferior frontal gyrus, in the left
superior frontal, right middle frontal, and the left frontal gyrus.
The main effect of semantic fluency versus overlearned fluency is
shown in Fig. 5.
In the ROI analysis of the left hemisphere, four clusters of
activation reached significance. Three of them were negligibly
small (<6 voxels). The main cluster of activation (1297 voxels)
overlapped mainly with left BA 45 (Fig. 6): 53% of BA 45 and
14% of BA 44 were activated (both maps were thresholded at 5/10
brains). A local maximum within this cluster (x = �42, y = 26, z =
22; T = 7.5) was located in BA 45 with a probability of 60%, while
its probability of lying in BA 44 was only 20%. Two additional,
single-voxel activations (x = �46, y = 6, z = 22; T = 4.0, and x =
�44, y = 6, z = 34; T = 3.9) had a probability of 50% for being
located in BA 44. A further cluster of six voxels (maximum at x =
�52, y = 0, z = 36; T = 3.9) showed a probability of 20% for lying
in BA 44. In the right hemispheric ROI, two activations were found
(local maxima at x = 38, y = 20, z = 6; T = 5.0, and x = 36, y = 32,
z = 28; T = 4.6). Both local maxima were well outside the centers
of BA 44 and 45. The maximal probability for them was only 10%
for BA 44 and 0% for BA 45.
The reverse comparison (overlearned, nonswitching + overlearned, switching > semantic, nonswitching + semantic, switching) did not reveal any significant activation.
The second main effect, switching (semantic, switching +
overlearned, switching > semantic, nonswitching + overlearned,
nonswitching), showed bilateral activation of the superior parietal
lobule. No other region was activated in this comparison (Gurd et
al., 2002). In the reverse comparison, that is, nonswitching versus
switching, no significant activations were found. Finally, the
interaction of semantic/overlearned and switching/nonswitching
resulted in an orbitofrontal activation (Fig. 7). This activation did
not overlap with either BA 44 and 45; it was located more
ventrally.

Discussion

The analysis of verbal fluency

Verbal fluency tasks have often been related to Broca’s region.
Studies employing PET and fMRI showed the participation of the
left inferior frontal gyrus in verbal fluency tests. Since lesions of
the (usually left) frontal cortex in patients often result in impaired
verbal fluency task performance (Baldo and Shimanura, 1998;
Owen et al., 1990), such tests are often used in the clinical
environment to measure the integrity and function of the frontal
cortex (Audenaert et al., 2000; Curtis et al., 2001; Ravnkilde et al.,
2002; Schlosser et al., 2002; Smith et al., 2002; Spence et al.,
2000). We accordingly here analyzed the relationship of cortical
activations during a verbal fluency task with respect to Broca’s
region and its putative correlates BA 44 and 45. Considering that,
in contrast to severe aphasic impairment on language and speech
tasks, preservation of so-called ‘‘automatic speech’’ (such as used
in this study) has been reported in patients with aphasia (Albert et
al., 1981), we also aimed to analyze the differential relationship of
cytoarchitectonically defined BA 44 and 45 with semantic verbal
fluency and ‘‘automatic’’ speech.
In this context, it is necessary to discuss verbal fluency in more
details. Verbal fluency tasks require the subject to produce as many


words as possible from some well-defined category (e.g., animals
or words beginning with the letter ‘‘s’’). In clinical practice,
patients are usually required to do so for 30 or 60 s per category.
Producing items from relatively large open-ended classes (such as
animals) can be contrasted with producing items from small closed
classes, such as days of the week or months of the year, whose
members and their sequence are usually much overlearned (‘‘automatic’’ speech).
The more open-ended semantic category tasks (e.g., listing
animals) are excellent, relatively pure measures of lexical retrieval.
Scoring can be both quantitative (number of words produced per
unit time) and qualitative (types of error produced). In healthy
elderly people, errors are rare but slowed times are common
(Lezak, 1995). Deficits on verbal fluency tasks occur in most
aphasic syndromes, including Broca’s aphasia, with errors characteristic of the particular aphasia type in question (Goodglass et al.,
1967). Importantly, patients with damage to left frontal areas, who
are not clinically aphasic, may also show impaired verbal fluency
(Janowsky et al., 1989). For the most part, however, errors are
perseverative in these cases; that is, the patients repeat previously
produced items (Baldo and Shimanura, 1998).
Furthermore, patients with idiopathic Parkinson’s disease (who
are not demented but have impaired dopaminergic projections to
prefrontal cortex) also show deficits in verbal fluency, producing
fewer items per unit time. This reduction is not entirely due to
peripheral articulatory disorder as the patients’ rate of speaking in
overlearned fluency tasks (e.g., days of the week) does not
correlate significantly with their performance on semantic category
fluency tasks (Gurd and Ward, 1989). In that study, both patients
and control subjects made a small proportion of repetition errors
and out-of-category errors.
In short, then, verbal fluency impairments can be seen not only
in patients with Broca’s aphasia after left frontal damage, but also
in nonaphasic patients with different types of frontal pathology.
Verbal fluency tasks primarily assess speed and accuracy of lexical
retrieval. It is thus unfortunate that the term ‘‘verbal fluency’’ is
also used to refer to rate of spontaneous speech, and articulatory
and intonational fluency in utterances. Although impairments of
fluency in the latter sense are also characteristic of Broca’s aphasia,
the verbal fluency tasks with which we are concerned here
specifically involve lexical access and retrieval of individual
words. Broca (1861) himself believed that the third left frontal
convolution (which came to be called Broca’s area) was primarily
concerned with memory for coordinating speech movements. Later
work established that the region was also implicated in lexical
retrieval as assessed by the types of verbal fluency tasks we use
here (Frith et al., 1991a; Hinke et al., 1993) as well as in syntactic
processes (Caplan et al., 2000). Thus, fluency impairments (in the
current sense) can be superimposed on the linguistic (including
prosodic) deficits of Broca’s aphasics (Belin et al., 1996; Goodglass et al., 1967).
The data from verbal fluency tasks used in previous imaging
studies show that large parts of the prefrontal cortex, exceeding
considerably the classical speech region, are activated. This finding
suggests a differential contribution of different cortical areas of the
inferior, medial, and superior frontal gyri to semantic and overlearned fluency. In this context, it is also necessary to consider the
putative role of working memory, strategic search, error control, and
monitoring in these process and their putative respective contribution to the neural activations observed. Clearly, the above-mentioned processes play a role in verbal fluency as studied here. The


-----

question is, however, whether there is a differential involvement of
these processes in semantic fluency as compared to overlearned
fluency. For example, maintenance in working memory has been
shown to be supported by a network of left hemispheric ventral
prefrontal, parietal, and motor regions (for an overview, see Fletcher
and Henson, 2001). However, we did not observe any differential
involvement of, for example, the inferior parietal cortex, which is
assumed to play a role in phonologic storage (Paulesu et al., 1993).
Further aspects of the relevant discussion have already been
provided in our earlier study (Gurd et al., 2002). Likewise, differences in strategic search might be expected when comparing
semantic and overlearned fluency. Frith et al. have reported bilateral
activations of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex when generative,
random keypressing was compared with reactive, stimulus-driven
keypressing (Frith et al., 1991b). Left dorsolateral prefrontal cortex
activation was also reported when random number generation was
compared with counting (Jahanshahi et al., 2000). Activation of the
ventral prefrontal cortex has also been reported with random
number generation compared to sequential counting (Jahanshahi
et al., 2000). The hypothesis was that prefrontal cortex was
involved in maintenance and monitoring processes required during
random generation of items. We did not observe activations in these
areas in the critical comparisons, but rather in all conditions relative
to baseline. With regard to the differential contribution of BA 44
and 45 during semantic verbal fluency, this suggests that working
memory load and supervisory processes were not greatly different
in semantic fluency versus overlearned fluency. Although we
cannot completely rule out the contribution of other factors which
are not directly related to semantics’ (e.g., differences in strategy,
selection), the data are consistent with the hypothesis that greater
semantic search is the critical factor in the comparison.

Stereotaxic localization of cytoarchitectonically defined BA 44
and 45

Observer-independent mapping of BA 44 and 45 postmortem
brains and subsequent elastic transformation into the stereotaxic
space of the reference brain enabled us to calculate probability
maps for both areas, containing frequency information about the
likely presence of these two areas in each voxel of the reference
space. The maps showed a high intersubject variability, both in
extent and location. The calculated centers of gravity are within the
range of the atlas data of Talairach and Tournoux (1988). Importantly, however, the extent of both areas was considerably larger
than the data provided by Talairach and Tournoux (1988) would
suggest. This is not surprising, since the Talairach and Tournoux
atlas is based on only one left hemisphere (which has not been
delineated cytoarchitectonically), whereas the present data rely on
cytoarchitectonic delineations of BA 44 and 45 in 20 hemispheres
of 10 postmortem brains. The discordance observed was maximal
for the mediolateral extent where it reached 23 mm (left BA 44).
The extent in the mediolateral direction was more or less arbitrarily
estimated by Talairach and Tournoux, since Brodmann’s map as
their model did not contain any explicit information about the
locations of areas within the depths of the sulci and therefore was
not helpful for architectonic localization in the mediolateral extent.
Finally, stereotaxic coordinates differ between left and right hemispheres. These differences are particularly relevant in languagerelated areas such as BA 44 and 45.
For one aspect of our structural–functional comparisons, only
those parts of the probability maps were considered which


coincided topographically in 5 or more of the 10 brains. The
criterion for selecting this threshold was to create maps which
show similar volumes to the averaged volume of the respective
cortical area in a single brain (Amunts et al., 1999). Furthermore,
only the selection of a threshold characteristic for a probabilistic
map allows one to discuss whether a whole cortical area or some
subarea thereof is involved in a particular brain function (e.g.,
53% of the voxels of left BA 45 were activated when semantic
fluency was compared with overlearned fluency). An alternative
approach makes use of the whole probabilistic map (overlap from
one to ten brains) and subsequent topographic interpretation of
both centers of gravity and maximal activation with respect to
this map (e.g., a peak of a cluster was located with a probability
of 60% in BA 45). Both approaches were applied in the present
study. They reflect different aspects of data analysis—one from
the perspective of the cortical area, the other from the perspective
of the functional activation—and thus supplement each other. In
contrast to the majority of functional imaging studies, where we
do not know the ‘‘real’’ extent and volume of a functional
activation, and therefore can only refer to statistical (or heuristic)
criteria to select thresholds (smoothing sizes, etc.), the volumes of
microscopically defined cortical areas can be objectively measured. Thus, the application of cytoarchitectonic maps represents
a significant step forward for localizing cortical areas and their
involvement in functional observations.

Localization of neural activations as the main effect of semantic
category fluency

The increases in neural activity observed overlapped with left
BA 44 and 45 when fluency was compared with rest (independently of switching and verbal category). Word production from
superordinate categories thus activates both BA 44 and 45. In
addition to these areas, other regions of the left and right middle,
superior and inferior frontal, and anterior cingulate gyri were
activated. When semantic fluency was compared with overlearned
sequence fluency and superimposed on the cytoarchitectonic maps,
activation of BA 45 was observed, which occupied a large portion
of this area. A very small extent of activation was also observed in
BA 44. The clusters of activation comprised only a few voxels and
hence should be interpreted with caution, since they are below the
resolution of the EPI images and smaller than the smoothing filters
applied. From a neuroscientific perspective, it is problematic to
interpret such small activations, since they suggest that only a
relatively small subpopulation of a cortical area participates in a
certain brain function. Such an assumption remains to be proven.
Therefore, we conclude that there was a crucial differential
activation of BA 45.
Activation of Broca’s region of the left hemisphere has been
reported previously in automatic speech tasks (Bookheimer et al.,
2000; Wildgruber et al., 1996) when compared with a low-level
baseline. We, therefore, conclude that verbal fluency per se
involves both left BA 44 and 45, which is in correspondence with
the interpretation of both areas as the anatomical correlates of
Broca’s region. The areas differ from each other, however, in their
participation in semantic processing—left BA 45 is more involved
than is BA 44 in verbal fluency tasks with high semantic load.
Evidence concerning a differential involvement of left prefrontal areas in speech production tasks, which draw upon different
aspects of semantic and phonologic processing with an anterior/
posterior gradient, has been provided in several studies (Buckner et

al., 1995; Crivello et al., 2002; Dapretto and Bookheimer, 1999;
Demonet et al., 1996; Fiez, 1997; Mummery et al., 1998; Poldrack
et al., 1999; Price, 2000; Thompson-Schill et al., 1997; Vandenberghe et al., 1996; Zatorre et al., 1996). Other language-related
functions, for example, syntax processing (Ben-Shachar et al.,
2003; Caplan et al., 1999; Dapretto and Bookheimer, 1999;
Embick et al., 2000; Indefrey et al., 2001), reading, or repeating
single words (Dapretto and Bookheimer, 1999; Fiez, 1997; Mummery et al., 1998), also seem to activate only parts of the inferior
frontal gyrus. In contrast to these studies, which related the
reported activations either to macroscopic structures such as the
opercular and triangular parts of the inferior frontal gyrus, posterior
and anterior parts, or which interpret their findings with respect to
the Brodmann scheme of the Talairach and Tournoux atlas, we
report here ‘‘in probabilistic terms’’ the differential participation of
BA 45 in semantic processing.
In addition to BA 45, other frontal regions were activated
when semantic category fluency was compared to overlearned
fluency. The semantic category fluency task is characterized by
increased search processes within the internal lexicon, whereas
‘‘automatic’’ speech minimizes such mechanisms (Gurd et al.,
2002). Semantic category fluency may thus be taken as an
example of intrinsic generation (Goldman-Rakic, 1987) in which
sequences of discrete responses must be made in the absence of
any external guidance other than the instructional set and without
the possibility of prepreparing particular responses. The generation of such sequences draws heavily upon the prefrontal cortex.
Participation of prefrontal cortex was accordingly observed when
semantic category fluency was compared with overlearned sequence fluency.
The ventral part of the inferior frontal gyrus was activated
bilaterally. These activations may underlie semantic processing
common to words and pictures (Vandenberghe et al., 1996) and
may also result from aspects of strategic control and on-line
retrieval of semantic information (Desmond et al., 1995; Fiez,
1997; Poldrack et al., 1999). The bilateral activations of the
anterior cingulate cortex are consistent with the role of this region
in response selection and task adherence (Stephan et al., 2003).
Semantic category fluency requires more suppression of inappropriate responses and facilitation of a wider range of withincategory responses than does overlearned sequence fluency (Paus
et al., 1993; Thompson-Schill et al., 1997).

Orbitofrontal activations

The orbitofrontal activation of both hemispheres shown in the
interaction term suggests an involvement of this region in semantic
processing (Fiez, 1997; Price, 1998; Gurd et al., 2002). Activations
of the more ventral parts of the frontal lobe during semantic
processing have previously been reported (Audenaert et al.,
2000; Blank et al., 2002; Gabrieli et al., 1998; Poldrack et al.,
1999). With respect to their intermediate location between BA 45
and 47, activations resulting, for example, from the comparison of
semantic and phonologic tasks (double subtraction), have been
interpreted as belonging to Brodmann’s areas 47 or to 45 (Poldrack
et al., 1999). The orbitofrontal activations of the interaction of the
present study did not overlap with the cytoarchitectonic maps of
BA 44 and 45; they were located more ventrally than the lower
borders of both areas. It can, therefore, be argued that the
activations belong to more ventrally located areas such as BA
47. Thus, cytoarchitectonic maps have improved the anatomical


interpretation of functional clusters of activation in ambiguous
locations with respect to two neighboring cortical areas.

Methodologic remarks and conclusions

The following differences were observed between the current
study and our previous analysis of the fMRI data (Gurd et al.,
2002)—the stereotaxic locations of the centers of gravity differed
within the range of a few millimeters; the cerebellar activation
reported previously did not survive the threshold in the present
study; and the activation of the left middle frontal gyrus reported
previously was shifted to a slightly more dorsal position in the
superior frontal gyrus. These subtle differences are the result of
methodologic changes, which were introduced to increase the
preciseness and accuracy of the anatomical interpretation of the
functional imaging data. These changes were as follows: (i) the
application of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps for analyzing
structure–functional correlation, (ii) the stereotaxic reference to an
alternative standard brain, (iii) the introduction of a non-SPM,
elastic warping tool to transform the in vivo MR data into the
common reference space, and (iv) an additional ROI-based statistical analysis. Thus, functional (EPI) and anatomical T1-weighted
images of the living human subjects (n = 11), as well as anatomical
postmortem data sets (n = 10) and their cytoarchitectonic areas,
were warped into the same reference space, using consistently the
same nonlinear warping tool. This strategy minimizes methodical
blurs and problems, which may occur, for example, when the
analysis of functional data is performed completely in SPM99
(with a SPM reference brain and the implied warping tools), and
the processing of the cytoarchitectonic data have been performed
with respect to a different reference brain and different warping
tools. The aim of our methodologic approach was to reach
consistency in the applied methods and standards, rather than to
make a methodical comparison with SPM99. The alternative way
to reach consistency, that is, the integration of cytoarchitectonic
maps into SPM99, appears to be an intriguing future project.
The combination of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps with
data from functional imaging may improve the topographic interpretation of fMRI data. Higher precision in the topographic
analysis of the functional activations is necessary as neurolinguistic
and neuropsychologic approaches test more and more specific,
detailed aspects of language processing, for example, the neural
substrates of particular syntactic rules (Ben-Shachar et al., 2003;
Friederici and Mecklinger, 1995; Zurif, 2000). Furthermore, several studies have been performed which suggest the participation of
Broca’s region in nonlanguage tasks, for example, in motion
perception (Binkofski et al., 2000; Koski et al., 2002) and in local
search (Manjali et al., 2003). The analysis of whether such
different tasks share common neural substrates in Broca’s region
depends, to a large extent, on the precision with which the
topography of the different activations can be defined.
In contrast to the atlas system of Talairach and Tournoux
(1988), the present probabilistic maps of cytoarchitectonic areas
are based on their microstructural delineation; they contain information about intersubject and interhemispheric differences, show
borders between cortical areas, have a higher spatial resolution, and
are related to an in vivo reference brain. These advantages make
them an appropriate tool for the analysis of structural–functional
relationship. Probabilistic maps have not yet been constructed for
the whole cerebral cortex. Although some activations observed in
the current study could be related precisely to a cortical area; others

(e.g., those of the orbitofrontal gyrus, the middle and superior
frontal gyrus) could not. These gaps in the cytoarchitectonic map
of the cerebral cortex will be remedied during the next few years.
Another problem results from the nature of the maps themselves—
they contain frequency-based information about the location of a
cortical area. Cortical areas are highly (but to a different degree)
variable in size and location. When the applied threshold is too
strict, the extent of the cortical areas will be underestimated, and
activations, which are located outside the thresholded map, may be
interpreted as being outside the area, although in fact, they still
belong to it. Vice versa, if one analyzes the relationship of an
activation with respect to the whole probabilistic map, one may get
several topographic interpretations for one and the same cluster. In
the latter case, the observer has finally to weigh these interpretations based on neuroscientific arguments. We have performed both
types of analysis here and found that the results are quite comparable. Intersubject variability has to be considered both in functional imaging of the cortex and in anatomical mapping. However,
intersubject variability does not only represent a ‘‘problem’’ or
‘‘noise’’ influencing the data, but also contains important information about individual differences which can be quantified. This is a
major advantage of probabilistic cytoarchitectonic maps.
Probabilistic maps are available in the format of the standard
reference brain of the ECHBD (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996).
They have also been transferred to the spatially normalized, T1weighted MR single-subject brain of the MNI (Evans et al., 1993;
Collins et al., 1994; Holmes et al., 1998). These maps can be
obtained via http://www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/cytoarchitectonics// and
http://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/oea[_]ime.
