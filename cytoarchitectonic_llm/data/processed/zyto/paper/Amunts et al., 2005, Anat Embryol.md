# Cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human amygdala, hippocampal region and entorhinal cortex: intersubject variability and probability maps

Published online: 6 October 2005
� Springer-Verlag 2005


Abstract Probabilistic maps of neocortical areas and
subcortical fiber tracts, warped to a common reference
brain, have been published using microscopic architectonic parcellations in ten human postmortem brains.
The maps have been successfully applied as topographical references for the anatomical localization of activations observed in functional imaging studies. Here, for
the first time, we present stereotaxic, probabilistic maps
of the hippocampus, the amygdala and the entorhinal
cortex and some of their subdivisions. Cytoarchitectonic
mapping was performed in serial, cell-body stained histological sections. The positions and the extent of cytoarchitectonically defined structures were traced in
digitized histological sections, 3-D reconstructed and
warped to the reference space of the MNI single subject
brain using both linear and non-linear elastic tools of
alignment. The probability maps and volumes of all
structures were calculated. The precise localization of
the borders of the mapped regions cannot be predicted
consistently by macroanatomical landmarks. Many
borders, e.g. between the subiculum and entorhinal
cortex, subiculum and Cornu ammonis, and amygdala

and hippocampus, do not match sulcal landmarks such
as the bottom of a sulcus. Only microscopic observation
enables the precise localization of the borders of these
brain regions. The superposition of the cytoarchitectonic
maps in the common spatial reference system shows a
considerably lower degree of intersubject variability in
size and position of the allocortical structures and nuclei
than the previously delineated neocortical areas. For the
first time, the present observations provide cytoarchitectonically verified maps of the human amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, which take into
account the stereotaxic position of the brain structures
as well as intersubject variability. We believe that these
maps are efficient tools for the precise microstructural
localization of fMRI, PET and anatomical MR data,
both in healthy and pathologically altered brains.

## Introduction

The human amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal
cortex are allocortical regions involved in emotional
processes, learning and memory. They have been frequently studied using functional imaging techniques
(functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) and
positron emission tomography (PET)) as well as in vivo
brain morphometry using structural MRI.
The amygdala is not a single homogeneous structure
but rather represents a complex of many subnuclei. The
subnuclei have been described using different parcellation
schemes (Heimer et al. 1999). The subnuclei of the
amygdala can be identified based on differences in their
cytoarchitecture, myeloarchitecture and chemoarchitecture (Brockhaus 1938, 1940). One of the most widely accepted classification schemes distinguishes the superficial
(corticoid) amygdaloid nuclei from the centromedial
group and the laterobasal complex (Heimer et al. 1999).

and subcortical structures in a coronal section of a human
postmortem brain. The centromedial nucleus is labelled by an orange
line and the basolateral complex by a red line. The VCo belongs to the
superficially located part of the amygdala. BL basolateral nucleus,

The amygdala has extensive afferent and efferent
connections with the diencephalon, the mediofrontal,
orbitofrontal and lateral prefrontal cortical regions,
hypothalamic nuclei, olfactory brain regions, basal
ganglia and the brain stem, whereby many connections
are reciprocal (Nieuwenhuys et al. 1988). The amygdala
is also strongly connected to the entorhinal cortex and
the subiculum. The numerous connections of the
amygdala are the structural basis of a large variety of
cognitive functions and affective behaviours such as
defence, escape, pain, motivation, emotional discrimination, learning and memory (Phelps 2004; Swanson
and Petrovich 1998; Ledoux 2000; Aggleton 2000).
Participation of the amygdala, hippocampus and
entorhinal cortex in affective functions and dysfunctions
has been demonstrated in many studies of the living
human brain (Schneider et al. 2000). Morphological and
functional imaging studies identified alterations of the
amygdala and the hippocampus in schizophrenia (Becker et al. 1996; Bogerts 1997; Heimer 2000; Conrad et al.
1991; van Erp et al. 2004). The activity of the amygdala
was decreased in patients with schizophrenia and healthy relatives as compared to healthy controls after
experimental induction of sadness (Habel et al. 2004;
Schneider et al. 1998). A PET study showed a lefthemispheric decrease of the glucose metabolism in such
patients (Nordahl et al. 1996). Several in vivo imaging
studies reported hippocampal volume reductions in patients with schizophrenia as compared to healthy volunteers (Nelson et al. 1998; Wright et al. 2000).
Morphometric analysis has also shown changes in the
entorhinal cortex and hippocampus in Alzheimer’s disease (Bobinski et al. 1999; Thompson et al. 2004).

the amygdala, the hippocampal region and/or the en

torhinal cortex in normal and pathologically altered
brains very often rely on their identification in structural
MR images of the individual brain. Most such studies
treat the structures as a whole. In some of them, anatomical interpretation is based on the atlas system of
Talairach and Tournoux (1988) which shows only very
approximate positions of the hippocampus and the
amygdala in one hemisphere.
Using in vivo MRI of the hippocampus, a rostral-tocaudal subdivision into head, body and tail has been
proposed (Kiefer et al. 2004). Several studies showed
differences between the anterior and posterior hippocampal regions in frontal lobe dysfunction (Narr et al.
2004; Schacter and Wagner 1999; Lepage et al. 1998).
The functionally relevant subdivisions into Fascia
dentata, subregions of the Cornu ammonis (CA 1–CA 4)
and subiculum are, however, beyond the spatial resolution of in vivo MRI using standard protocols. For
example, the thickness of the CA regions goes down to
less than 1 mm, which is less than the spatial resolution
of routine MRI on whole-body, clinical scanners. The
same holds true for the subdivision of the amygdala even
for coarse parcellations such as the Supraamygdaleum
and the Amygdalaeum proprium by Brockhaus (1938).
Detailed information on subnuclei of the amygdala is
currently not available from in vivo imaging studies
(Brierley et al. 2002). Furthermore, the relatively low
contrast of the amygdala does not enable an unambiguous delineation from neighbouring regions, e.g. at the
border of the cortical nucleus of the amygdala and the
neocortex, between the amygdala and the caudate nucleus, and between the amygdala and the hippocampus
(Figs. 1, 2). Such information, however, is important,
since the different nuclei of the amygdala (and regions of
the hippocampus) are segregated not only by their

the body of the hippocampus (a), and its head (b). The hippocampus

architecture and connectivity, but also by their vulnerability in age-related changes and neuropsychiatric disorders (Harding et al. 1998; Heimer 2000; Irwin et al.
2004; Simic et al. 1997; Narr et al. 2004).
Therefore, we have generated architectonic maps of
the Cornu ammonis, the subicular complex, Fascia
dentata together with CA4, the hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (HATA), the amygdala with its
centromedial, superficial and laterobasal nuclear groups
as well as the entorhinal cortex taking advantage of the
high spatial resolution of microscopic techniques. The
individual maps were reconstructed in 3D and transferred to a stereotaxic reference space in order to provide
a tool for the required detailed localization of future
functional and structural MRI data of patients with
neuropschiatric disorders and healthy controls.

## Materials and methods

Cytoarchitectonic mapping (Figs. 1, 2) was performed
as previously described (Zilles et al. 2002; Amunts and
Zilles 2001) in serial coronal sections (thickness: 20 lm,
silver staining by Merker (1983) for cell bodies) in both
hemispheres of ten postmortem human brains (five
males, five females; mean age: 64.9 years, SD=16.9)
with no history of neurological or psychiatric diseases.
Brains were taken from body donors in accordance with
the guidelines of the Ethics Committee of the University
of Du¨ sseldorf. Handedness was unknown. In order to
correct for distortions, inevitable during histological
processing, the fixed post-mortem brains were placed in
a cylindrical container filled with formalin and placed in
the headcoil of an MRI scanner. The measurement


HATA, the subicular complex and the entorhinal cortex are labelled
by different colours. Note that cytoarchitectonic borders of the
different subdivisions do not coincide with sulci in most cases

protocol was carried out on a Siemens 1.5 T scanner
(Siemens Medical Systems GmbH, Erlangen, Germany)
equipped with a gradient system capable of 25 mT/m;
the standard radiofrequency head coil was used for
signal reception and transmission of radiofrequency
excitation pulses. Images were acquired with a T1weighted FLASH sequence covering the entire brain
(flip angle =40�, repetition time, TR=540 ms, echo
time TE=5.5 ms for each image). Spatial resolution was
1·1·1.17 mm. These MR images served as a reference
for the 3-D reconstruction of the histological sections
and their cytoarchitectonic structures (Schormann and
Zilles 1998). The 3-D reconstructions of the histological
data sets were calculated on the basis of three original
data sets: (i) the MR scan of the fixed brain prior to
embedding in paraffin, (ii) the blockfaces of the paraffin
blocks which were obtained during histological sectioning, and (iii) the images of the cell-body stained histological sections (Amunts et al. 1999; Schormann and
Zilles 1998; Zilles et al. 2002; Henn et al. 1997).
The following structures were identified:

1. Hippocampal formation (Amaral and Insausti 1990).

– Cornu ammonis (CA1–CA3).
– Dentate gyrus (DG) including Fascia dentata and
CA4 (Duvernoy 1988).
– Subicular complex (including the prosubiculum,
subiculum proper, presubiculum and parasubiculum (Duvernoy 1988; Rosene and van Hoesen
1987).

2. Hippocampal-amygdaloid transition area (HATA), a
component of the uncal hippocampal formation
(Rosene and van Hoesen 1987).


-----

3. Amygdala (Heimer et al. 1999).

– Superficial group (includes the anterior amygdaloid area, the amygdalopyriform transition area,
the amygdaloid-hippocampal area and the ventral
(intermediate, dorsal, ventral) and posterior cortical nuclei).
– Centromedial group (central nucleus and medial
nucleus).
– Laterobasal group (lateral nucleus, basolateral,
basomedial and paralaminar nuclei).

4. Entorhinal cortex (Heinsen et al. 1996; Krimer et al.
1997; Braak 1972).

The borders of these eight structures were interactively traced on images of histological sections (Figs. 1,
2) of the 3-D reconstructed post-mortem brain data sets
and registered to standard reference space (see below).

Volume measurements

The volumes of the structures (Table 1) were calculated
based on measurements of the area of the delineated
structures in images of the individual histological section
using the following formula:

X
V ¼ s � T � x � y � Ai � F

where V is the volume of the cortical region (mm[3]), s is
the distance between two measured sections (60), T is the
thickness of a histological section (0.020 mm), x is the
width of a pixel (0.02116 mm), y is the height of a pixel
(0.02116 mm), SAi is the sum of areas across all i sections evaluated (in pixels) and F is the shrinkage factor
of each individual brain.
Areas were measured using the KS400[�] image analyzing system (Zeiss, Germany). Depending on the extent of each area, 7–20 sections were analyzed per
hemisphere and brain.
In order to estimate the true volumes, shrinkage due
to histological processing has to be taken into account.
Shrinkage differs with respect to age, sex, clinical history, brain size, cause of death, autopsy conditions,
histological techniques and other factors (Blinkov and
Glezer 1968; Haug 1980; Skullerud 1985; Vierordt 1893).
The individual shrinkage factors of the postmortem
brains were defined as the ratio between the estimated
fresh volume of the brain and its volume after histological processing (histological sections). The fresh


volumes were calculated from the fresh weight of the
brain and a mean specific density of 1.033 (Kretschmann
and Wingert 1971). The volumes of the histological sections were calculated based on area measurements of the
brain tissue in the digitized histological sections (resolution of the digitized images: 14.000·12.000 pixels).

3-D reconstruction of microscopical structures and
generation of probabilistic maps

All cytoarchitectonic structures were 3-D reconstructed,
and registered to the stereotaxic space of the MNI reference brain (Collins et al. 1994; Holmes et al. 1998;
Evans et al. 1993) using a combination of linear affine
transformation, grey level normalization and non-linear,
elastic alignment (Henn et al. 1997; Amunts et al. 2004;
Mohlberg et al. 2003).
The MNI reference space is a frequently applied
reference space in functional imaging, e.g. in the software environment of SPM (http://www.fil.ion.ucl.ac.uk/
spm). This reference space, however, is not precisely
aligned to the AC–PC line, connecting the anterior with
the posterior commissure (Brett et al. 2002). The origin
of the system of coordinates of the MNI space is not
defined by the upper edge of the anterior commissure.
The coordinates in y and z direction of the MNI space
do not correspond to distances from the AC–PC line as
in Talairach space (Talairach and Tournoux 1988). The
anterior commissure, however, is a consistent anatomical landmark, which is easy to identify in routine MR
images. Therefore, orientation of MR data with respect
to the AC–PC line is well accepted in neurosurgery as
well as in many functional imaging studies (Talairach
and Tournoux 1988; Roland and Zilles 1994; Hardy
et al. 1992). The two spaces, the MNI space and the
stereotaxic reference space with the origin at the AC, can
easily be transformed into each other. We have used
such a transformation in the present study. Consequently, the origins of the data were shifted by a linear
affine transformation (translation in y and z plane by 4
and 5 mm, respectively) in such a way that the anterior
commissure (at the level of the inter-hemispheric fissure)
coincided with the origin of the reference space
(=anatomical MNI space, orientation according to the
AC–PC plane).
In a final step, probability maps of all structures were
calculated. Probability maps indicate the relative fre

## Results

Cytoarchitectonic borders and macroanatomical
landmarks

Amygdala

The borders of the amygdala do not coincide, over a
large extent, with macroanatomical landmarks whereas


other borders fit well. The endorhinal sulcus marks the
border to the amygdaloid body for its cortical nucleus
(Fig. 1). Parts of ventral borders of the lateral nucleus,
the basoventral and basolateral nuclei are indicated by
the lateral ventricle (Fig. 1). In contrast, the dorsal
borders of the centromedial part of the amygdala (central and medial nuclei) can only be detected at a
microscopical level since these two nuclei consist of
loosely packed cells (Fig. 1). Such low packing density


-----

of cells makes it difficult or even impossible to distinguish the nuclei from neighbouring structures (Nucleus
basalis of Meynert, white matter) at a macroscopical
magnification.

Hippocampal formation and HATA

The positions of the borders of these structures also
cannot be precisely and reliably predicted by macroscopic, anatomical landmarks. The borders between the
subiculum and the entorhinal cortex, the subiculum and
Cornu ammonis, the amygdala and the HATA region
did not coincide with macroscopically visible anatomical
landmarks, and are a few examples of this lack of correlation between macroanatomy and cytoarchitecture
(Fig. 2).
At the transition between the entorhinal cortex, the
hippocampal formation and the amygdala, HATA
(Fig. 2b) is inserted between the medial entorhinal cortex, the cortical nucleus of the amygdala, CA1 and the
subiculum (Rosene and van Hoesen 1987). The HATA
has been interpreted as (the most rostral) part of the
uncal hippocampal formation (Rosene and van Hoesen
1987), and corresponds cytoarchitectonically to CA˘ of
Stephan (Stephan 1975). The HATA shows a laminar
structure, but does not show a Stratum radiatum and
Stratum oriens as in CA1. Neurons in HATA are more
densely packed and smaller than those of CA1 and the
subiculum.
The dentate gyrus with Fascia dentata is a structure,
which can clearly be distinguished from the neighbouring Cornu ammonis due to its densely packed band of
granular cells. It is often applied as an ‘‘internal’’ landmark of the rostro-caudal extent of the hippocampus.
Our cytoarchitectonic analysis showed, however, that
HATA reaches more rostral levels than the Fascia
dentata (Fig. 4a). It exceeds it by a few millimetres. That
is, the Fascia dentata (which is also clearly visible in
MRI) is not a precise marker of the rostral extent of the
hippocampus. Taking the Fascia as an indicator of the
hippocampus would result in an underestimation of the
hippocampus with respect to its rostral border.

Entorhinal cortex

The entorhinal cortex belongs to the periallocortex. It
occupies the parahippocampal gyrus. The entorhinal
cortex shows characteristic neuronal islands in layer II,
cellular clusters in the superficial part of layer III and a
cell-free layer Lamina dissecans (Krimer et al. 1997).
Medially, the entorhinal cortex borders to the subiculum
whereas isocortical areas adjoin the entorhinal cortex
laterally. The lateral border of the entorhinal cortex is
roughly marked by the collateral sulcus. The exact position of the lateral border of the entorhinal cortex may
vary with respect to the fundus of this sulcus by several
millimetres (compare the positions in Figs. 2a and b). In


the most rostral sections, however, the lateral border of
the entorhinal cortex may also be marked by the rhinal
sulcus. The entorhinal cortex may reach the lateral bank
of the rhinal cortex if the sulcus is shallow.

Intersubject variability in regional volumes

Table 1 shows the volumes of the subdivisions of the
hippocampus and the amygdala. The mean volumes of
the whole amygdala (±SD) are 1536±286 mm[3] (left
hemisphere) and 1526±272 mm[3] (right hemisphere).
The volumes of the hippocampus were 4713 in the left
and 4484 mm[3] in the right hemisphere. The entorhinal
cortex had a volume of 1745 in the left and 1678 mm[3] in
the right hemisphere (Table 1). The individual volumes
varied by a factor of 1.7–2 between the different brains
with exception of HATA, which varied by a factor of 3.
Interhemispheric and sex related differences in volume
were not found.

Intersubject variability in extent and location

The registration of the individual cytoarchitectonic
maps of the different brains to the common reference
space (anatomical MNI space, see Materials and methods) showed a low degree of intersubject variability in
extent and location, and, thus, a high overlap in stereotaxic space (Fig. 3). This was particularly true for the
entorhinal cortex, and the laterobasal complex of the
amygdala. In contrast, the intersubject variability of
HATA was the maximal in the group of analyzed
structures (maximal overlap of 6–7 brains in a few
voxels).
Based on the probabilistic maps of the delineated
structures, combined cytoarchitectonic maps have been
calculated (see materials and methods, Fig. 4). These
maps show a non-overlapping parcellation of the mesial
temporal lobe in the anatomical MNI space. They
visualize the spatial relationship of the different structures to each other.

## Discussion and conclusions

The present paper provides for the first time cytoarchitectonically verified maps of the amygdala, hippocampus and entorhinal cortex after normalization in
stereotaxic space, which consider and quantify the intersubject variability in extent and location of these
structures. Whereas some subcortical nuclei, e.g. the
striatum, subthalamic nucleus (Pierantozzi et al. 1999)
and a few cortical regions, e.g. the entorhinal, perirhinal
and temporopolar cortices, have been reported to be
reliably identified on MR scans of the living human
brain (Insausti et al. 1998; Blaizot et al. 2004; Pruessner
et al. 2002) probabilistic maps based on microscopical


-----

observations are superior in those regions where sulcal
landmarks do not reflect cytoarchitectonic boundaries.
This is particularly true at the transition of the Cornu
ammonis region to the subicular complex, and (ii) in
brain regions with low differences between neighbouring
regions in contrast (e.g. dorsal and medial borders of the
amygdala in structural MR images).
The mapping of the amygdala, the hippocampus and
the entorhinal cortex, regions critically involved in
neural mechanisms of emotional processing, cognition
as well as learning and memory, is important for a
reliable localization of these brain functions. Thus, it
supports attempts to understand the pathophysiology of
neuropsychiatric and neurodegenerative disorders.
Probability maps are presently the only approach if a
more fine-grained parcellation is required for an anatomical localization of functional imaging data, e.g. with
respect to delineations of the subnuclei of the amygdala.
Such finer parcellation schemes will play an increasing
role with further development of the spatial resolution of
MRI, considering that the subnuclei of the amygdala
differ in function, architecture and connectivity (Pikkarainen and Pitka¨ nen 2001; Pitka¨ nen et al. 2002; Heimer
et al. 1999; Bozkurt et al. 2001). They also differ with
respect to their involvement in brain pathology. For
example, it has been shown that a proportion of the
Lewy bodies-containing neurones in the basolateral
nucleus of patients with Parkinson’s disease is nearly
doubled in cases that exhibited visual hallucinations,
suggesting that neuronal dysfunction in this particular
subnucleus contributes to this late clinical feature,
whereas other subnuclei seem to be unchanged (Harding
et al. 2002).
A differentiation between the subnuclei of the
amygdala in routine MRI is not feasible because of its
relatively low spatial resolution and low contrast. As a
consequence, volumes of interest in the amygdala have
often been defined not based on its boundaries, but
using geometrical structures, e.g. spherical volumes of
interest (Heiss et al. 2004). Such geometrically defined
volumes of interest, however, include unpredictable
portions of neighbouring tissue, including the white
substance and isocortical areas.
The intersubject variability in volume of the allocortical region structures was found to be considerably
lower than that of previously studied isocortical areas,
e.g. areas 44 and 45 of Broca’s region (Amunts et al.
1999). The volumes of these two areas differed by a
factor of up to 7 when individual shrinkage was considered whereas factors of up to 2 were observed for the
allocortical region of the present study. The HATA
showed the maximal variability in volumes (factor 3).
This high variability in volume as well as the low
absolute volume of HATA resulted in a relatively low
overlap in the probabilistic cytoarchitectonic map.
The low variability of the amygdala, hippocampus
and entorhinal cortex may be a characteristic aspect of
phylogenetically older structures as compared to neo(iso-) cortical areas. Since the probabilistic maps of the


allocortical (and periallocortical) brain regions show
such a high overlap in the common reference space, the
probability maps are precise and efficient tools for the
anatomical localization of functional imaging data from
both healthy human subjects and neuropsychiatric patients. They can also be applied as microscopically defined regions of interest for the precise topographical
analysis of receptor PET studies as shown by Hurlemann et al. in this volume (Hurlemann et al. 2005).
The probabilistic maps are available at http://
www.fz-juelich.de/ime/ime_start/ and http://
www.bic.mni.mcgill.ca/. They can easily be applied
using a toolbox developed for the application of cytoarchitectonic probabilistic maps as an option integrated in the SPM software (Eickhoff et al. 2005). The
toolbox can also be downloaded at http://www.fz-juelich.de/ime/ime_start/.
