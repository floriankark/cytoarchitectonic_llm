# Probabilistic Maps, Morphometry, and Variability of Cytoarchitectonic Areas in the Human Superior Parietal Cortex

Recently, 8 areas (5Ci, 5M, 5L, 7PC, 7A, 7P, 7M, hIP3) in the human
superior parietal cortex (SPC) were delineated in 10 postmortem
brains using observer-independent cytoarchitectonic analysis. Here
we present 3D probabilistic maps of these areas, quantifying the
interindividual overlap for each voxel in stereotaxic reference
space, and a maximum probability map, providing a contiguous
parcellation. For all areas, we determined probabilities of mutual
borders, calculated stereotaxic centers of gravity, and estimated
volumes. A basic pattern of areas and borders was observed, which
showed, however, intersubject variations and a significant interhemispheric asymmetry (7P, 7M) that may be functionally
relevant. There was a trend toward higher intersubject anatomical
variability in lateral compared with medial areas. For several
areas (5M, 7PC, 7A, 7P), variability was significantly higher in the
left hemisphere and/or in men, whereas for areas 5Ci and 5M
there was a hemisphere-by-gender interaction. Differences in anatomical variability could bias group analyses in functional imaging
studies by reducing sensitivity for activations of entities with high
variability. The probabilistic maps provide an objective anatomical
reference and account for the structural variability of the human
brain. Integrated into functional imaging experiments, they can
improve structure--function investigations of the human SPC.

Introduction

Macroanatomically, the human superior parietal cortex (SPC) is
subdivided into 4 parts (Fig. 1): 1) the superior parietal lobule
(SPL) is framed anteriorly by the postcentral sulcus (PoCS),
posteriorly by the lateral extension of the parieto-occipital
sulcus (POS), and laterally by the intraparietal sulcus (IPS); 2)
the medial wall of the IPS; 3) the posterior part of the
paracentral lobule (PCL) is located medially, posterior to the
medial extension of the central sulcus (CS), and dorsal and
anterior to the posterior cingulate sulcus (CiS); and 4) the
precuneus (PrC) is also located medially, but caudal of the CiS,
which separates it from the PCL. Its posterior border is the
POS, and its ventral border the subparietal sulcus (SuPS).
The human SPC and IPS play a key role in cognitive
processes, in particular somatosensory and visuomotor integration as well as visuospatial attention and memory (for
review, see Culham et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006). These
functions implicate, however, distinct subregions with differential preference (Lim et al. 1994; Allison et al. 1996; Sakakibara
et al. 1999; Raichle et al. 2001; Grefkes et al. 2004; Simon et al.

et al. 2006; Fiehler et al. 2007; Hagler et al. 2007; Molenberghs
et al. 2007). It is likely that a complex mosaic of structurally
distinct microanatomical areas in the human SPC and IPS
underlies this functional heterogeneity. In addition to specializations within the SPC and IPS, structural and functional
differences between hemispheres and genders have been
reported which are, however, still under debate (Kennedy
et al. 1998; Gro¨ n et al. 2000; Gur et al. 2000; Unterrainer et al.
2000, 2005; Dietrich et al. 2001; Good et al. 2001b; Watkins
et al. 2001; Allen et al. 2002, 2003; Jordan et al. 2002; Weiss

Ohnishi et al. 2006; Barrick et al. 2007; Gorbet and Sergio
2007).
In his widely used cytoarchitectonic map (Fig. 2), Brodmann
(1909) parcellated the SPC into area 5 anteriorly, located on
the posterior PCL and anterior SPL, and area 7 more posteriorly
on the SPL and the PrC (later he subdivided area 7 into anterior
area 7a and posterior area 7b; Fig. 2; Brodmann 1914). In other
less frequently used maps, however, parcellations were
suggested that were considerably different with respect to
the number and location of areas (Vogt 1911; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al. 1955; Batsch
1956). Reasons for these discrepancies include different
histological staining techniques, different subjective criteria
for the delineation of microanatomical areas, and sample sizes
that were too small to account for the considerable interindividual anatomical variability of the human brain (Zilles
et al. 2002, 2003; Uylings et al. 2005).
Oriented on macroanatomical landmarks, Talairach and
Tournoux (1988) transferred Brodmann’s 2D schematic drawings to their 3D stereotaxic atlas, which is frequently used as
anatomical reference in functional imaging experiments.
However, this atlas cannot be used to reliably assign functional
activations to cytoarchitectonic areas because the precision of
the transformation from Brodmann’s drawings to the stereotaxic atlas is unknown. Furthermore, this atlas does not account
for the considerable interindividual anatomical variability of the
human brain. This variability makes it impossible to estimate
the precise location of cytoarchitectonic areas and their
borders from macroanatomical structures like gyri or sulci
(Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Amunts et al. 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001;
Morosan et al. 2001; Zilles et al. 2002; Uylings et al. 2005;
Caspers et al. 2006; Choi et al. 2006; Eickhoff, Amunts, et al.
2006a; Eickhoff, Schleicher, et al. 2006c; Malikovic et al. 2007;
Rottschy et al. 2007; Scheperjans et al. 2007). Another
drawback is that the abovementioned detailed functional
pattern of areas in the SPC and IPS is not reflected in sufficient

detail by Brodmann’s (1909, 1914) cytoarchitectonic bipartition (Fig. 2) and hence also not in the atlas of Talairach and
Tournoux (1988).
Recently, based on multimodal analysis of cyto- and
receptorarchitecture in postmortem brains, a new parcellation
of the human SPC was suggested, comprising 8 distinct
microanatomical areas (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al., 2005;
Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005, Scheperjans
et al. 2007). Three of these areas were delineated in the region
of Brodmann’s area (BA) 5 (5Ci, 5M, 5L), 4 were found in the
region of BA 7 (7PC, 7A, 7P, 7M), whereas area hIP3 was
described in the anterior part of the medial wall of the IPS
(amIPS). Consequently, the new parcellation (Scheperjans,
Grefkes, et al., 2005; Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al.
2005, Scheperjans et al. 2007) considerably extends and
modifies that of Brodmann (1909, 1914; Fig. 2) by introducing
further subdivisions of BAs 5 and 7 and by defining a new
cytoarchitectonic area (hIP3) in the amIPS. Additionally, our
recent cytoarchitectonic study (Scheperjans et al. 2007) has
important methodological advantages compared with previous
anatomical investigations (Brodmann 1909, 1914; Vogt 1911;
von Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al.
1955; Batsch 1956). An observer-independent approach was
used for the detection of cytoarchitectonic borders, and each

area was mapped in 10 postmortem brains to account for
interindividual anatomical variability (Schleicher et al. 1999,
2000, 2005; Amunts and Zilles 2001; Zilles et al. 2002).
In the present study, we used this cytoarchitectonic
parcellation of the human SPC (Scheperjans et al. 2007)
together with established techniques for spatial normalization
and image processing (Henn et al. 1997; Ho¨ mke 2006) to
calculate 3D probabilistic maps and a maximum probability
map (MPM) of this region in the stereotaxic reference space of
the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI; Evans et al. 1992;
Amunts and Zilles 2001; Mazziotta et al. 2001; van Essen 2004;
Eickhoff et al. 2005). Furthermore, we looked for anatomical
correlates of observed functional/behavioral differences. The
topographical relations between the areas were investigated
based on the probability of mutual borders and on the
comparison of their stereotaxic centers of gravity and volumes
(Amunts et al. 2007). The data were further analyzed with
respect to systematic differences between hemispheres or
genders and with respect to the intersubject anatomical
variability.

Materials and Methods

Cytoarchitectonic Mapping and 3D Reconstruction
Twelve human postmortem brains (6 male, 6 female, age range 37--86
years) were histologically processed (Table 1), and 8 areas were
delineated in the SPC using an observer-independent algorithm for the
detection of cytoarchitectonic borders (for details, see Schleicher et al.
1999; Scheperjans et al. 2007). Due to artifacts in the histological
sections of some brains, the samples analyzed for area 7M differed from
those of the other areas. Eight brains were analyzed with respect to all
areas, 2 were analyzed for area 7M only, and 2 were analyzed for all
areas except area 7M. Thus, each area was mapped in 10 brains.
The locations of each area, including layers I--VI, were interactively
labelled in high-resolution scans (1200 dpi; ~20 lm/pixel; 8 bit gray
value resolution) of the respective equidistant histological sections
(Fig. 3; section thickness = 20 lm; section spacing 0.9--1.2 mm). The
brains and representations of the areas were 3D reconstructed (Fig. 4)
using 1) the high-resolution scans of the histological sections providing
detailed anatomical information, but with strong deformation and no
spatial reference, and 2) a structural magnetic resonance imaging 3D
volume data set (3D FLASH sequence, flip angle = 40�, repetition time
TR = 40 ms, echo time TE = 5 ms, 128 sagittal sections, spatial resolution
1 3 1 3 1.17 mm, 8 bit gray value resolution) obtained between fixation
and embedding of the respective brain with only minor deformations
but lower spatial resolution (Ho¨ mke 2006).

Spatial Normalization and Probabilistic Maps
The reconstructed postmortem brains were subsequently spatially
normalized to the T1-weighted single-subject template of the MNI
(Evans et al. 1992) using a nonlinear elastic registration algorithm
(Henn et al. 1997; Ho¨ mke 2006). Because the origin of the MNI
reference space is located 4 mm more caudally (y-axis) and 5 mm more
dorsally (z-axis) than the anterior commissure of this specific template
brain, the data were shifted by this offset to ‘‘anatomical MNI space’’
(Amunts et al. 2005). Hereby, the anterior commissure was maintained
as the anatomical reference of the coordinate system.
The representations of each delineated cytoarchitectonic area
from the individual brains were then superimposed in this common
reference space. Thereafter, probabilistic maps were calculated for
each area by assigning frequency values (0/10--10/10) to each voxel
of the reference brain quantifying the local degree of overlap
(i.e., probability) across the 10 postmortem brains. For visualization
of these maps, 1st the border between gray and white matter was
determined from the volume data set of the MNI single-subject
template and the triangulated white matter surface was calculated
(Fig. 5: RAW; ~10[5] vertices per hemisphere; average distance between
neighbouring vertices = 1.05 ± 0.2 mm; BrainVISA; Mangin et al. 2004).
Secondly, the white matter surface and the Gaussian filtered (standard
deviation [SD] = 2 mm) volume data set of each probabilistic map
were superimposed. The overlap of the nearest voxel of the map was
assigned to each vertex of the surface, and this overlay was
subsequently median filtered. To reveal the topography of the map
within the sulci, the surface was inflated up to a point where most
sulci were flattened and where only major anatomical structures were
still visible (Fig. 5: INFLATED; BrainVISA; Mangin et al. 2004). Vertex
points with overlaps between 3/10 and 10/10 were color coded
(Fig. 5).

Maximum Probability Map
To generate a contiguous, nonoverlapping parcellation of the SPC, an
MPM (Eickhoff et al. 2005; Eickhoff, Heim, et al. 2006) was calculated
from the probabilistic maps of the 8 areas as well as previously
mapped areas of the surrounding precentral (BA 4), postcentral (areas
3a and 3b, BAs 1 and 2), and intraparietal (hIP1 and hIP2) cortex
(Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001; Choi et al. 2006). This
map was computed by comparing the probabilities for each area
(i.e., the counts of overlapping representations) in each voxel and
assigning that voxel to the cytoarchitectonic area with the highest
probability (Eickhoff et al. 2005). If areas showed equal probabilities,
the respective voxel was assigned to the area with the higher average
probability in the 26 directly adjacent voxels. In regions with no
overlap of at least 2 probabilistic maps (e.g., at borders to yet
unmapped regions), only voxels with a frequency value of at least
4/10 were included in the MPM (Eickhoff et al. 2005). It is important
to note that the MPM does not show the parcellation or cytoarchitectonic borders of an exemplary or typical hemisphere as do classical
architectonic brain maps (e g Brodmann 1909) but reflects in each


voxel of the reference brain the most likely area from a sample of
10 postmortem brains. Furthermore, it provides a better representation of the true volumes of the included areas than a combination of
thresholded probabilistic maps (Eickhoff et al. 2005; Eickhoff, Heim,
et al. 2006). The surfaces of the MPM and of the white matter of the
template brain were reconstructed, superimposed, and visualized
(Figs. 6--9) using Amira 4.1.0 (Mercury Computer Systems, Inc,
Chelmsford, MA).

Analysis of Cytoarchitectonic Borders
We investigated the topographical relations of the cytoarchitectonic
areas and their variability by analyzing the probability of mutual borders
(Table 2). This analysis supplements previously published data
concerning the precise location of these borders with respect to
anatomical landmarks (Scheperjans et al. 2007). The patterns of areas of
the individual brains were visualized using Amira 4.1.0 (Mercury
Computer Systems, Inc) and used together with the scanned
histological sections for evaluation of the hemispheres (Table 2 and
Figs. 3 and 4). Topographical relations between area 7M and the
remaining areas of the SPC were examined in the subsample in which
all 8 areas had been delineated (16 hemispheres). Topographical
relations between the areas of the SPC and the surrounding cortex
were examined in the subsample (14 hemispheres) that had previously
been used for the delineation of adjacent areas as well (4, 3a, 3b, 1, 2,
hIP1, and hIP2; Geyer et al. 1996, 1999; Grefkes et al. 2001; Choi et al.
2006). To look for interhemispheric differences in the pattern of
mutual borders, we tested for each border that was present in some,
but not all, hemispheres for the independence between the hemisphere and the probability with which the border was present.
Therefore, we used 2-by-2 contingency tables and Fisher’s exact test
(2 tailed; significance level P [<] 0.05).

Analysis of Stereotaxic Centers of Gravity
Furthermore, the topographical relations were analyzed based on
stereotaxic centers of gravity that were calculated for each area and
hemisphere after spatial normalization (Table 3). Differences of the
absolute values of the coordinates (means across right and left
hemispheres) between areas (Fig. 10) were tested for significance
separately for each axis using pairwise permutation tests. For each of
these tests, the 20 values were 1st grouped according to their true label
(10 for area x and area y, respectively) and a contrast estimate was
calculated between the means of these groups. The null distribution
was estimated by Monte-Carlo simulation. The 20 values were randomly
redistributed into 2 groups, the same contrast was calculated, and this
procedure was repeated for 100 000 iterations. The difference between
the 2 areas was considered significant if the contrast estimate of
the true comparison was larger than 95% of the values under random
(i.e., null) distribution (P [<] 0.05; Eickhoff et al. 2007). The calculated
centers of gravity were subsequently also compared with those of the
MPM (Table 3).
The calculation of the probabilistic maps and of the stereotaxic
centers of gravity used for the pairwise comparisons between areas
(Table 3 and Fig. 10) was based on the nonlinear elastic registration of
the individual postmortem brains to the reference brain (see above).
This algorithm largely reduces intersubject differences of brain shape
and size and removes nonlinear distortion caused by histological
processing. However, it can influence interhemispheric differences of
the individual postmortem brains, by introducing shape asymmetries
that are determined by the asymmetry of the target brain, that is, the
reference brain (Amunts et al. 2000). For this reason, we used the data
sets from the individual postmortem brains after a linear affine
registration to the reference brain for the analysis of interhemispheric
and gender-specific influences on the stereotaxic centers of gravity.
This registration reduced intersubject variability in brain size and
position but did not affect interhemispheric asymmetries (Amunts et al.
2000). For each area and axis, differences of the absolute coordinates
were tested for significant effects of hemisphere and gender, as well as
of the interaction of these factors using the permutation test.
Topographical variation in stereotaxic location was quantified for
each area hemisphere and axis by the SD of the coordinates of the

centers of gravity (Table 3 and Figs. 10 and 11). Differences in the
stereotaxic variance between areas (derived from mean absolute
coordinates across hemispheres after nonlinear registration) were
tested for each axis across both hemispheres using pairwise


permutation tests as described above. The permutation test was
likewise applied to test differences in variance for significant effects
of hemisphere and gender, as well as of the interaction of these factors
(after linear registration)

sulci. Note the complex shape of the areas, particularly in the walls of the sulci, and
the lateral extension of left area 5L reaching up to area hIP3 at the junction of the
PoCS and IPS.

Volumetry
The fresh total volume of each brain was estimated from its fresh
weight and a mean density of 1033 kg/m[3] (Table 1; Kretschmann and
Wingert 1971). The volume after histological processing (histological
volume) was calculated based on area measurements of the brain tissue
in the digitized histological sections (Amunts et al. 2005). To
compensate for shrinkage due to histological processing, an individual
correction factor was defined for each postmortem brain as the ratio
between its fresh volume and its histological volume (mean: 2.01; range:
1.47--2.45). The fresh volume (Fig. 12) of each cytoarchitectonic area
was stereologically estimated in each hemisphere using the delineations in the digitized histological sections (Fig. 3), Cavalieri’s principle,
and the correction factor (Uylings et al. 1986; Amunts et al. 1999, 2005,
2007). Because male brains (1357 ± 183 cm[3]) were on average 16%
larger than female brains (1168 ± 137 cm[3]), the volume of each area in
each brain was expressed as a fraction of total brain volume to avoid
a confounding influence of total volume (Table 1). Pairwise permutation tests were used to test differences of the volume fraction between
areas (means of right and left hemispheres). For each area, differences
of the volume fraction were tested for significant effects of hemisphere
and gender, as well as of the interaction of these factors using the
permutation test.
For each area, interindividual variability of its volume fraction was
quantified by the coefficient of variation (CV = SD/mean) separately for
hemispheres and genders (Fig. 12). Pairwise permutation tests were
used to test CV differences between areas (derived from mean volume
fractions across hemispheres) for significance. Likewise, permutation
tests were used for each area to test differences in the CV for
significant effects of hemisphere and gender and of the interaction of
these factors.
For the present study, very high standards were installed concerning
the quality of the tissue and the medical history of the donors
(e.g., short postmortem delay, no neurological or psychiatric diseases,
and high quality of histological preparations). The application of
these strict criteria, which are an important prerequisite for the
precise analysis of cortical architecture, limits the availability of
suitable brains and it was therefore not possible to use age-matched


samples for both genders. Thus the question arises, whether our
analysis of gender differences is confounded by age. Several studies
have shown that age effects on cortical anatomy in the SPC are much
weaker than for example in the frontal lobe (Raz et al. 1997;
Moore et al. 2005). Furthermore, the age-related decrease of
cortical volume in the SPC is mainly related to the decrease of
total brain volume (Good et al. 2001a). In particular, the latter
observation is critical for the evaluation of our data, as in the present
study all volumetric data were normalized to total brain volume
before analysis.
To test whether in the present analysis age differences had
a confounding effect on our analysis of gender differences, we tested
for a correlation between the volume fraction and age. For none of the
cytoarchitectonic areas, a significant correlation was observed. The
mean Fisher’s z from both hemispheres was �z = 0:30±0:19 corresponding to a mean Pearson’s correlation coefficient of �r = 0:29. Also in our
preceding study (Scheperjans et al. 2007), which was performed
on the same sample of brains, none of the investigated histological
parameters showed a significant correlation with age. Hence, although
we cannot completely exclude a confounding effect of age on our
analysis of gender differences, it can be estimated that this effect is
very small.

Results

Probabilistic Maps and MPM
Figure 5 shows the color-coded probabilistic maps for each
area overlayed onto the inflated white matter surface of the
MNI single-subject template brain. Due to the high interindividual anatomical variability, voxels/vertices in the periphery of
the maps with low overlap (i.e., probabilities; blue) were more
frequent than central voxels/vertices with high overlap (red).
Therefore, the maps of different areas overlapped considerably
at lower frequencies.
A nonoverlapping parcellation of the SPC was obtained by
combining the individual probabilistic maps and creating an
MPM that showed a pattern of areas similar to those of the
individual brains (Figs. 4 and 6--9; see below). On the lateral
surface, the most anterior areas were 5L and 7PC occupying
large parts of the posterior wall of the PoCS (Figs. 6--8). Area 5L
extended to the postcentral gyrus and also medially to the
posterior PCL and CiS (Figs. 6--8). Area 7PC reached to the
superficial part of the amIPS in both hemispheres (Figs. 6--8).
On the medial surface, area 5M was located ventral to area 5L
on the posterior PCL and in the CiS (Figs. 6 and 9). Area 5Ci was
located deeper inside the CiS than area 5M and extending more
anteriorly (Figs. 6 and 9) having borders with the cingulate
cortex. On the lateral surface, area 7A was abutting areas 5L
and 7PC posteriorly, reaching to the posterior wall of the
PoCS on the left. Bilaterally, it extended to superficial parts of
the medial wall of the IPS and to the PrC with borders to areas
hIP3 and 7M and the posterior cingulate cortex, respectively
(Figs. 6--8). Its posterior border was to area 7P that also
extended to the medial wall of the IPS and to the PrC,
bordering area 7M bilaterally and the posterior cingulate
cortex on the left (Figs. 6--8). Area 7M occupied the posterior
ventral PrC and did not reach to the lateral surface (Fig. 6).
Medial parts of BA 7 were represented dorsal and ventral to
the SuPS (Fig. 6). Posteriorly, areas 7P and 7M extended to
superficial parts of the anterior wall of the POS (Figs. 6--8).
In the amIPS, area hIP3 was located near the junction with
the PoCS and had medial borders to areas 7PC and 7A (Figs. 6
and 8)

Analysis of Intersubject Variability and Interhemispheric
Asymmetry of Cytoarchitectonic Borders
Several borders were present in all hemispheres (5Ci/5M,
5M/5L, 5L/7PC, 7PC/7A, 7A/7P; Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4) and
also represented in the MPM (see above; Figs. 6--9). Area 5L also
frequently had a border to area 7A (85%; Table 2). Area 7P
bordered area 7M in all but 1 hemisphere (94%; Table 2),
when a posterior extension of area 7A separated these 2 areas.
Area hIP3 very frequently had a border to areas 7PC and 7A
(95% and 90%, respectively; Table 2) but rarely to area 7P (10%;
Table 2). However, considerable variations were observed
between subjects and hemispheres as, for example, the border
between areas 5M and 5L could be located on the medial
or lateral surface of the hemisphere (Figs. 3, 4, and 6;
cf. Scheperjans et al. 2007). Between individual hemispheres,
such differences of the location of areas led to differences in
the pattern of interareal borders. For this reason, several
borders were found with lower probabilities in the sample, for
example, in only 25% of the hemispheres area 5L extended
laterally up to the junction of the PoCS and IPS and had
a border with area hIP3 (Table 2 and Figs. 3 and 4).
Considerable intersubject variability was also present with
respect to the topographical relations between the areas of
the SPC and the surrounding cortex (Table 2). Only the
anterior border of area 5M to the motor cortex (BA 4), the
posterior borders of areas 7P (laterally) and 7M (medially) to
the parieto-occipital cortex, and the medial ventral borders of
areas 5Ci (anterior) and 7M (posterior) to the cingulate
cortex (aCi: ventral to the PCL; pCi: ventral to the PrC) were
present in all hemispheres (Table 2). Frequent borders to the
somatosensory cortex (Table 2) were found between areas
5M and 3a/3b (86%/79%) and between areas 5L and 2 (86%).
In the IPS, area hIP3 had almost always a border with area hIP2
(93%) but only in half of the hemispheres with area hIP1
(Table 2) Medial ventral borders to the posterior cingulate

for example, area 5M was always located medial to area 5L
(Figs. 4 and 7), and the centers of gravity of all areas differed
significantly from each other in at least 2 dimensions. Focusing
on the areas that very frequently had borders to each other (see
above; Table 2), the following spatial relations were confirmed
by significantly different coordinates (Table 3 and Fig. 10): area
5Ci was lateral, anterior, and ventral to area 5M (i.e., area 5Ci
was located deeper in the CiS); area 5M was medial, anterior,
and ventral to area 5L; area 5L was medial and dorsal to area
7PC; area 7A was lateral, posterior, and ventral to area 5L and
medial and posterior to area 7PC; area 7P was medial, posterior,
and ventral to area 7A; area 7M was medial and ventral to area
7P; and area hIP3 was lateral and ventral to areas 7PC and 7A
(i.e., area hIP3 was located deeper in the amIPS), posterior to
area 7PC and anterior to area 7A These spatial relations can

thus be regarded as a constant basic topographical pattern of
areas in the SPC (Figs. 6--10). With the exception of the left
X-coordinate of area 7M, all centers of gravity of the respective areas in the MPM were located within 1 SD of the mean
coordinates across the individual centers of gravity (Table 3).
The permutation test revealed that the centers of gravity for
areas 7P and 7M were located significantly more lateral in the
right than in the left hemisphere. No significant effect of
gender and no significant interaction were observed.
The analysis of the variance of the centers of gravity (Fig. 10)
revealed no significant differences in the stereotaxic variation
between the 8 areas in the pairwise comparisons. However, we
observed significantly higher variation in the left hemisphere
(y-axis: 7A and 7P) and in males (y-axis: 5M; z-axis: 5M, 7PC, 7A,
7P). A significant interaction of the factors hemisphere and
gender was found for the variance of the X-coordinate of
area 5Ci and of the Y-coordinate of area 5M (Fig. 11). For both
areas, the variation was higher in the left hemisphere in males
(Fig. 11). Particularly for area 5Ci, there was in addition higher
righthemispheric variation in females (Fig. 11).

Volumetry
The average total volume fraction (% brain volume ± SD) of BAs
5 and 7 in those hemispheres that had been mapped with
respect to all areas (n = 16) was 1.0055 ± 0.2614 (men: 1.0160 ±
0.3128; women: 0.9950 ± 0.2200; P > 0.05). Of the 8 delineated
areas, the average volume fraction per hemisphere (n = 20) was
largest for area 7A (0.3304 ± 0.2060) and smallest for areas 7M
(0.0372 ± 0.0120) and 5Ci (0.0496 ± 0.0231). The remaining
areas had intermediate volume fractions (5M: 0.1145 ± 0.0604;
5L: 0.1637 ± 0.0764; 7PC: 0.1270 ± 0.0843; 7P: 0.1522 ± 0.0665;
hIP3: 0.1102 ± 0.0675). With respect to the mean volume
fraction across hemispheres (Fig. 12: middle), area 7M was
significantly smaller than area 5Ci and both were significantly
smaller than all other investigated areas. Area 7A was
significantly larger than all other areas. Furthermore, area 5L
was significantly larger than areas 5M and hIP3. No significant
differences of the volume fraction between hemispheres
(Fig. 12: top) or genders (Fig. 12: middle) and no significant
interaction were observed

between areas were not significant (Fig. 12: bottom). Neither
a significant effect of hemisphere or gender nor an interaction
was observed (Fig. 12: bottom). However, there was a trend
toward higher variability in males for areas 5M, 5L, 7PC, 7A, and
hIP3 (Fig. 12: bottom).

Discussion

In the present study, we analyzed topographical, stereotaxic,
and volumetric data for 8 superior parietal cytoarchitectonic
areas that were delineated by observer-independent techniques in a previous study (Scheperjans et al. 2007). We also
provided probabilistic maps of these areas and an MPM of the
SPC in standard MNI space.

of the Y-coordinate of area 5M separately for men, women, and hemispheres. This
measure of interindividual stereotaxic variation of the center of gravity was calculated
from the individual brains after linear registration. The significant interaction of the
factors hemisphere and gender (permutation test) was based on higher variation in the
left hemisphere of males and in the right hemisphere of females (nf þ nm 5 5 þ 5).

The volume fractions (% brain volume) of all areas showed
strong variations between the 20 hemispheres, with the largest
range (minimum-maximum; maximum/minimum) for area
hIP3 (0.0129--0.2990; 23.14) and the smallest for area 7M
(0.0198--0.0583; 2.94). Intersubject variations were quantified
by the coefficients of variation (CV; Fig. 12: bottom). Based on
the mean volume fractions across hemispheres, medial areas
5Ci and 7M showed relatively small variations compared with
the remaining areas (Fig 12: bottom) However the differences


Parcellation and Topographical Relations of
Cytoarchitectonic Areas in Structure and Function
The SPC and IPS are involved in various cognitive processes, in
particular somatosensory and visuomotor integration as well as
visuospatial attention and memory (for review, see Culham
et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006). Reaching or pointing movements
activate mainly anterior parts of the SPC when they are based
predominantly on somatosensory information, whereas visual
guidance implicates more posterior parts (Simon et al. 2004;
Stoeckel et al. 2004; Wenderoth et al. 2006; Fiehler et al. 2007).
A stronger representation of somatosensory information in the
anterior areas of the SPL and of visual information in the
posterior areas was also suggested by receptorarchitectonic
findings (Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005), showing that receptor distribution patterns in the anterior SPL are
similar to those of the postcentral somatosensory cortex
(BA 2), whereas patterns in posterior SPL resemble those of
the extrastriate visual cortex (BA 19). Further supporting this
segregation on the structural level is a study reporting that the

posterior SPL and medial wall of the IPS have a higher
probability of fiber connections with the superior colliculus,
a key structure for the control of eye movements, than the
anterior SPL (Rushworth et al. 2006).
Anatomical and functional observations have suggested
a similar rostrocaudal subdivision of the macaque SPC. The
anterior SPC integrates mainly information from the somatosensory cortex (Pandya and Seltzer 1982) and provides the
dorsal premotor cortex (PMd) with a spatial representation of
the body parts (Mountcastle et al. 1975; Jones et al. 1978;
Lacquaniti et al. 1995). The posterior SPC, in contrast, receives
input from the visual cortex and is an important source of
visual information for PMd in the context of visually guided
reaching movements (Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Caminiti et al.
1996; Marconi et al. 2001; Battaglia-Mayer and Caminiti 2002).
In both human and monkey SPC, however, visuospatial
processing seems to be less regionally confined than somatosensory processing (Macaluso et al. 2003; Orban et al. 2006;
Filimon et al. 2007; Hagler et al. 2007).
The abovementioned functional rostrocaudal bipartition in
the human SPC supports Brodmann’s (1909, 1914) parcellation
into 2 main areas (Fig. 2), BA 5 (anterior) and BA 7 (posterior).
While principally confirming this basic segregation, the present
and the preceding studies (Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005;
Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005; Scheperjans et al.
2007) demonstrated a more complex pattern of 8 areas in the
SPC (anterior: 5Ci, 5M, 5L, and 7PC; posterior: 7A, 7P, and 7M)
and amIPS (hIP3). On the microstructural level, when both
receptor- and cytoarchitectonic features are considered
(Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005; Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005; Scheperjans, et al. 2007), a gradual
transition from anterior BA 5 to posterior area 7P, across areas
7PC and 7A, was observed. Although there was a strong
anatomical variability in our sample (Figs. 5, 10, and 12), the
stereotaxic centers of gravity of the delineated areas were well
separated and several significant differences in the volume
fraction were observed between areas (Table 3 and Figs. 10 and
12). In combination with the analysis of cytoarchitectonic
borders (Table 2), which revealed that several borders were
observed consistently across hemispheres and subjects, a constant basic topographical pattern of areas emerged, which was
reflected in the MPM (Figs. 6--10).
The further subdivisions in the SPC described here thus
extend the parcellation of this region beyond Brodmann’s
(1909) rostrocaudal bipartition into BAs 5 and 7. They
correspond well to the more detailed pattern of functionally
distinct areas recently demonstrated in humans and to
structural and functional observations in macaque monkeys
(Lewis and van Essen 2000; Simon et al. 2004; Grefkes and Fink
2005). Concerning the macaque SPC, recent studies have
extended the initially proposed segregation between areas PE
and PEc (Pandya and Seltzer 1982), arguing for an additional
rostrocaudal gradient within area PEc (Marconi et al. 2001).
These gradients might correspond to the structural transitions
in the human SPC mentioned above. However, the areas of
the human SPC are not simply arranged in a rostrocaudal sequence because area 7PC is located lateral to area 5L. In the
macaque cortex, so far no area has been described that would
topologically correspond to human area 7PC. However, by
mapping topically organized sensory and visuomotor representations (Sereno and Huang 2006), a superior parietal area has
been recently functionally identified in the human brain at


-----

a location comparable to that of our area 7PC, which supports
our parcellation.
Functional differences between areas of the SPL and IPS have
been described, for example, for attentional processes. During
the remapping of attentional priorities, a region in the anterior
IPS is more implicated by endogenously guided attention shifts,
as compared with exogenous shifts, than the SPL (Molenberghs
et al. 2007), corroborating our definition of area hIP3 in the
amIPS. Further supporting our structural parcellation in the
medial wall of the IPS are reports about several functionally
defined human intraparietal areas (e.g., DIPSM, DIPSA, hMIP,
mIPS, IPS1--3; Grefkes et al. 2004; Grefkes and Fink 2005;
Culham et al. 2006; Iacoboni 2006; Orban et al. 2006; Hagler
et al. 2007) and about anatomically and functionally characterized areas PEip (anterior) and MIP (posterior) in the macaque
brain (Matelli et al. 1998; Lewis and van Essen 2000; Grefkes
and Fink 2005).
Functional dissociations between lateral (SPL) and medial
(PCL, PrC) parts of the SPC have been reported as well. The
anterior medial SPC, that is, the PCL, is the most important
among parietal areas for micturition control (Sakakibara et al.
1999) and has sensorimotor functions (Lim et al. 1994; Allison
et al. 1996), corroborating our cyto- and receptorarchitectonic
findings of distinct areas (e.g., area 5M) in this region
(Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al. 2005; Scheperjans et al. 2007).
No mediolateral subdivisions have so far been described for
area PE in the anterior macaque SPC that could be homologues
of the here described areas 5L and 5M. However, the higher
order sensorimotor area PEci in the macaque CiS might
correspond to area 5Ci (Pandya and Seltzer 1982; Shima et al.
1991; Morecraft et al. 2004). In the more posterior SPC, there
are functional differences between the SPL and PrC during
visuospatial navigation (Gro¨ n et al. 2000; Ohnishi et al. 2006),
and the PrC belongs to the so called cortical midline structures
related to self-referential processing (Raichle et al. 2001;
Cavanna and Trimble 2006; Northoff et al. 2006). This supports
our observation of structural differences between the SPL and
the PrC, namely the delineation of subarea 7M. Furthermore,
this area lies at a location comparable to that of area PGm in the
macaque brain (Pandya and Seltzer 1982).
Functional subdivisions within the PrC have been suggested
with a focus on self-centered mental imagery and attentional
processes in the anterior part and on episodic memory retrieval
and saccade-related activity in the posterior part (Simon et al.
2004; Cavanna and Trimble 2006), which seems to be
structurally reflected in our parcellation, namely anterior area
7A and more posterior areas 7P and 7M.
In line with the abovementioned structural and functional
findings of multiple distinct areas, it has been shown that
anatomical alterations and hypoactivations of circumscribed
parts of the SPC and IPS are behaviorally relevant in certain
disorders with central nervous system involvement (e.g., gray
matter reduction in the posterior IPS and hypoactivation
around the IPS and lateral SPL are related to visuospatial
cognitive deficits in Williams syndrome; Meyer-Lindenberg
et al. 2004; Eckert et al. 2005, 2006).
Although the here presented parcellation shows considerable similarities with current concepts of the macaque SPC,
noteworthy differences were observed, for example, the
mediolateral subdivisions in the anterior human SPC (subareas
5L, 5M, and 7PC). Future structural and/or functional studies
may elucidate whether homologues of these subareas can be


identified also in nonhuman primates or whether they are
human specific. It is likely that the cytoarchitectonic areas
presented in this study are structural correlates of complex
functional segregations in the human SPC and IPS (Figs. 6--9;
Scheperjans, Grefkes, et al., 2005; Scheperjans, PalomeroGallagher, et al. 2005; Scheperjans et al. 2007). The probabilistic maps of these areas in stereotaxic space constitute an
objective anatomical reference and can now be integrated
into functional imaging experiments to explore in detail the
complex relationships between structure and function in this
region in health and disease (Eickhoff et al. 2005; Eickhoff,
Heim, et al. 2006).

Anatomical Variability of Areas
We observed a strong interindividual anatomical variability of
the superior parietal cytoarchitectonic areas in the present
study. Previously, CV values for the whole parietal lobe volume
(gray and white matter) between 0.09 and 0.13 were reported
(Allen et al. 2002). Based on the fresh absolute volumes that we
calculated for the SPC in our sample, including only gray
matter, our values were about twice as high (female: 0.21; male:
0.25; area hIP3 excluded) and comparable to those of a previous
study (Kennedy et al. 1998). This suggests that the volume
variability in the SPC is stronger for the gray than for the white
matter. Kennedy et al. (1998) also described regionally differential cortical volume variability in the SPC, namely lower
variation of volumes in the PrC than in the SPL (CV: 0.13--0.35).
This is in line with our finding of a trend toward higher volume
variability for lateral areas compared with medial areas 5Ci and
7M (Fig. 12).
We demonstrated that a considerable number of cytoarchitectonic borders are not present in every brain (Table 2).
Additionally, the locations of these borders are not reliably
associated with macroanatomical landmarks (Scheperjans et al.
2007). We conclude that, although a basic constant pattern of
areas exists in the SPC (see above; Figs. 6--10), the precise
arrangement of areas and borders, however, is not identical in
every brain, due to anatomical variations of areas within this
pattern. This is in line with a recent study demonstrating
a strong interindividual variability of the pattern of functionally
identified areas in the SPC and IPS (Hagler et al. 2007). These
findings argue against the assumption underlying nearly all
historical cortical maps (Brodmann 1909, 1914; Vogt,1911; von
Economo and Koskinas 1925; Gerhardt 1940; Sarkisov et al.
1955; Batsch 1956) and also their adaptations used frequently
as anatomical reference for modern imaging experiments
(Talairach and Tournoux 1988), that there is a constant pattern
of areas and borders common to all individual human brains.
This demonstrates the need for a probabilistic anatomical
reference that accounts for this intersubject variability (Amunts
and Zilles 2001; Zilles et al. 2002; Eickhoff et al. 2005; Eickhoff,
Heim, et al. 2006).

Differences between Hemispheres and Genders

Stereotaxic Centers of Gravity
In our sample, the position of the centers of gravity for
posterior subareas of BA 7 (areas 7P and 7M) was significantly
more lateral in the right hemisphere. Putative methodological
factors that may influence left--right differences were minimized. First, during fixation the brains were hanging on their
basilar artery to avoid weight-induced shifts to one or the other


-----

hemisphere and subsequent deformations induced by contact
with the container (Amunts et al. 2000; Scheperjans et al.
2007). Second, for the analysis of interhemispheric differences,
only a linear alignment of the postmortem brains to the
reference brain was applied that transforms both hemispheres
in the same manner (Amunts et al. 2000). Furthermore, in
parallel with the interhemispheric difference observed for the
center of area 7P, this area also showed interhemispheric
asymmetries in terms of the location of its borders in relation to
anatomical landmarks, as we reported in a previous study
(Scheperjans et al. 2007). Therefore, this interhemispheric
asymmetry in location likely reflects a topographical asymmetry
of the living human brain with potential functional relevance
and appears to be independent of gender.

Volume
A comparison of our data with previously published macrostructural investigations is not easy due to varying sample sizes,
different measured parameters, and various techniques used for
the definition of regions of interest. All these points may be
responsible for conflicting results. One study reported that the
volume of the whole parietal lobe (gray and white matter) was
larger in males and showed a rightward asymmetry in females
(Allen et al. 2002; nm + nf = 23 + 23). Reports about gray matter
asymmetries are inconsistent. Asymmetries in terms of cortical
thickness have been reported for the SPL (left > right) and PrC
(right - left) with more pronounced differences in men
(Luders et al. 2006; nm + nf = 30 + 30). A 2nd study
measured higher volume of the SPC in males without
asymmetries (Kennedy et al. 1998; nm + nf = 10 + 10). A 3rd
publication reported no hemispheric asymmetries but a higher
parietal gray matter concentration in females (Good et al.
2001b; nm + nf = 265 + 200), whereas another mentioned
higher amounts of parietal gray matter in the left hemispheres
of both genders (Watkins et al. 2001; nm + nf = 81 + 61). A more
recent study reported that only in the left hemisphere the
volume of parietal gray matter was larger in males and that only
in females there was a rightward asymmetry (Allen et al. 2003;
nm + nf = 23 + 23).
The abovementioned studies demonstrate that differential
parietal macroanatomy between genders and hemispheres still
is a matter of debate. Our volumetric methods have shown
good sensitivity for detection of interhemispheric or genderrelated differences in sample sizes comparable to that of the
present study (Amunts et al. 2007). For example, it was
recently demonstrated for the visual cortex that volume
differences between genders do not necessarily involve a whole
cortical lobe but can affect individual cytoarchitectonic areas
specifically (Amunts et al. 2007). Such structural differences
may be functionally relevant. However, they cannot be reliably
detected when volumetric measurements are performed in
regions of interest that are defined by macroscopical landmarks
only, waiving microstructural information.
In the present study, we found no significant interhemispheric or gender-related volume differences for the areas of
the SPC after adjustment for differences of total brain volume
(Fig. 12). Also, no interhemispheric or gender differences of
cytoarchitecture were detected in the study preceding this
investigation (Scheperjans et al. 2007). When comparing our
results with those of Amunts et al. (2007), it must be
considered that gender differences of brain size are generally
more pronounced in the frontal and occipital lobes than in the


parietal region (Sowell et al. 2007). Our findings are in
agreement with a recent study of cortical thickness in a large
sample (nm + nf = 90 + 86) in which gender differences in the
SPC were not significant and far less pronounced than in the
inferior parietal cortex (Sowell et al. 2007). However, genderand hemisphere-specific differences in brain activation patterns
have been described for the SPC (see below) and may be
associated with other anatomical asymmetries. For example,
rightward asymmetry of superior parietal white matter pathways was recently demonstrated (Barrick et al. 2007).

Topographical Pattern of Areas
Significant interhemispheric differences for individual areas
were detected concerning their stereotaxic location (7P, 7M)
but not concerning their volume fractions. No interhemispheric differences were observed in terms of the probability
of mutual borders between areas. However, in a previous
study (Scheperjans et al. 2007), we demonstrated that the
relative location of certain cytoarchitectonic areas/borders to
macroanatomical landmarks shows interhemispheric differences. Taken together, these findings suggest that, within each
subject, the relative positional pattern of areas and borders in
the SPC was similar in both hemispheres, whereas within this
pattern there were systematic spatial shifts between left and
right hemispheres. These shifts were associated with differences mainly of the position but less of the volume fraction of
areas.

Anatomical Variability
A previous study reported higher CV values for the whole
parietal lobe volume for females and the right hemisphere
(Allen et al. 2002), whereas a higher CV for the cortical volume
of the SPL in females and no gender difference in the PrC were
observed in another publication (Kennedy et al. 1998). To our
knowledge, our study is the 1st to present volumetric data for
the SPC that is not based on macroscopically defined regions
of interest but on cytoarchitectonically defined areas. We
found no significant interhemispheric or gender differences of
volume variation after adjustment for differences of total brain
volume (Fig. 12). However, there was a trend toward higher
volume variability in males for several areas (5M, 5L, 7PC, 7A,
hIP3). Additionally, hemisphere and gender had significant
influence on the variability of the stereotaxic location of several
areas (5M, 7PC, 7A, 7P), and interhemispheric differences
of stereotaxic variation were gender specific in parts of BA 5
(Fig. 11). Thus, we demonstrated that the intersubject
anatomical variations of different cytoarchitectonic areas
underlie different gender- and hemisphere-specific influences.
Therefore, differences in the selection of the regions of interest
between volumetric studies may be an important factor for
disagreements. A possible genetic background and functional
correlates of these findings remain to be elucidated; however,
our results may have implications for the design and interpretation of functional imaging studies (see below).

Implications for Functional Imaging Experiments
It is not completely understood what kind of structural
correlates may underlie reported functional/behavioral differences between parietal areas (see above) and between
hemispheres, genders, or individual subjects (see below).
Nevertheless it seems reasonable to assume that structural


-----

differences are related to differential functional properties
(see above; Scheperjans, Palomero-Gallagher, et al. 2005),
and indeed, associations of parietal gray and white matter
organization and performance in visuospatial tasks have been
demonstrated recently (Meyer-Lindenberg et al. 2004; Eckert
et al. 2005; Tuch et al. 2005; Wolbers et al. 2006). In previous
imaging studies, many tasks involving reaching were associated
with contra- or bilateral superior parietal activations (Culham et al.
2006; Filimon et al. 2007). Rightward lateralization has been
described for attentional processes, movement planning, and
visuomotor transformations (Barthe´ le´ my and Boulinguez 2002;
Culham et al. 2006) and may be related to the structural
asymmetries observed in the present study. However, with respect to visuospatial tasks, it is important to note that interhemispheric integration and functional connectivity of the SPC
are context dependent (Stephan et al. 2007) and that therefore
differential hemispheric involvement must not necessarily manifest itself as constant interhemispheric anatomical differences.
As demonstrated here and in our previous study (Scheperjans
et al. 2007), there are strong and regionally differential
intersubject anatomical variations of the cytoarchitectonic
areas in the SPC (see above), and it is not possible to predict
the precise location of these cytoarchitectonic areas and their
borders on the basis of macroanatomical landmarks (Zilles et al.
2002; Uylings et al. 2005). When in functional imaging studies
(e.g., functional magnetic resonance imaging) brain activations
are analyzed, the individual data sets are spatially normalized to
correct for macroanatomical intersubject variation before
statistical analysis across subjects. The applied algorithms are
usually based on the alignment of macroanatomical features
and corresponding parts of the individual brains get superimposed. If, in such a study, a group of subjects performs
a specific task, the same cytoarchitectonic area may get
specifically activated in all subjects. If this microanatomical
area would always be found at the same position in relation to
macroanatomical landmarks, it could be expected that the
voxels representing this area in the individual subjects are all
superimposed at the same stereotaxic location after normalization, resulting in a significant activation in these voxels across
subjects. However, if such a cytoarchitectonic area varied in
size and location between subjects independently of macroanatomical landmarks, as demonstrated here for the areas of
the SPC, the individual activations would not necessarily be
superimposed after spatial normalization. This factor is not
considered in the commonly used anatomical references
(Talairach and Tournoux 1988) and has the potential to blur
the activation in the group analysis for areas with high
variability so that no significant activation would be detected.
Consequently, the high anatomical variability of cytoarchitectonic areas in the SPC may have been a contributing factor in
studies that showed a reduction of sensitivity in group analyses
caused by differential parietal activation patterns between
subjects performing the same task (e.g., motor skill acquisition;
Schlaug et al. 1994).
Different intensities of these variations between areas
(Fig. 12) may contribute to the observation that activations of
some areas are detected in both single-subject and group
analyses, whereas activations of other areas are obscured on
the group level (Schlaug et al. 1994). Furthermore, the higher
anatomical variability in left areas 7A and 7P (SPL), that is not
found for area 7M (PrC), may result in a lower sensitivity for the
detection of left-sided SPL activations and may have con

founded previous imaging studies reporting that functional
lateralization is less pronounced in the PrC, compared with the
SPL (Cavanna and Trimble 2006).
It is well established that men on average perform better
than women in visuospatial tasks like mental rotation (Voyer
et al. 1995) or navigation (Astur et al. 1998). The relationship of
this phenomenon to brain activation patterns in the SPC is
under discussion. There is disagreement about the theory that
differential activation patterns for men and women are not
gender specific but for the most part explicable by differences
in performance (Gro¨ n et al. 2000; Unterrainer et al. 2000, 2005;
Jordan et al. 2002; Weiss et al. 2003; Boghi et al. 2006; Halari
et al. 2006; Ohnishi et al. 2006; Gorbet and Sergio 2007). The
here presented findings may be important for the design and
interpretation of functional imaging studies analyzing such
differences. For example, a recent study reported stronger
bilateral activation at the junction of the PoCS and IPS in
women compared with men during a mental rotation task
independent of performance (Jordan et al. 2002). It is possible
that in the group analysis of male subjects an anterior superior
parietal activation of, for example, area 7PC, was weaker
detected due to stronger anatomical variability in comparison
with the female group. It has furthermore been suggested that
1 reason for the superior visuospatial performance in males is
their stronger rightward functional lateralization in the parietal
lobe (Gur et al. 2000), but this has been challenged by other
authors (Dietrich et al. 2001; Halari et al. 2006). The stronger leftsided variability in men for parts of BA 5 could reduce the
sensitivity for the detection of activations in the left hemisphere
of male subjects and a similar effect may be relevant for
righthemispheric activations in females. Such factors could bias
analyses of gender-specific functional asymmetries and have so
far not been considered in functional imaging studies.
The probabilistic maps of the SPC presented here constitute
an objective anatomical reference and allow separate analyses
for each cytoarchitectonic area in both hemispheres. They
furthermore account for interindividual variability. By integrating them into functional imaging studies (Eickhoff et al. 2005;
Eickhoff, Heim, et al. 2006), researchers can now investigate
the complex structure--function relationships in this brain
region more precisely and reliably.
