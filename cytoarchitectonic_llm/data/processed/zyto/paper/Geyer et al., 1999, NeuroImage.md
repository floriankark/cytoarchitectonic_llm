**This study defines cytoarchitectonic areas 3a, 3b,**
**and 1 of the human primary somatosensory cortex by**
**objective delineation of cytoarchitectonic borders and**
**ensuing cytoarchitectonic classification. This avoids**
**subjective evaluation of microstructural differences**
**which has so far been the only way to structurally**
**define cortical areas. Ten brains were fixed in formalin**
**or Bodian’s fixative, embedded in paraffin, sectioned as**
**a whole in the coronal plane at 20 µm, and cell stained.**
**Cell bodies were segmented from the background by**
**adaptive thresholding. Equidistant density profiles**
**(125 µm wide, spacing 300 or 150 µm) were extracted**
**perpendicularly to the pial surface across cortical**
**layers II–VI and processed with multivariate statisti-**
**cal procedures. Positions of significant differences in**
**shape between adjacent groups of profiles were corre-**
**lated with the cytoarchitectonic pattern. Statistically**
**significant borders can be reproduced at correspond-**
**ing positions across a series of nearby sections. They**
**match visible changes in cytoarchitecture in the cell-**
**stained sections. Area 3a lies in the fundus of the**
**central sulcus, and area 3b in the rostral bank of the**
**postcentral gyrus. Area 1 lies on its crown and reaches**
**down into the postcentral sulcus. Interareal borders,**
**however, do not match macrostructural landmarks of**
**the postcentral gyrus, and they considerably vary in**
**their positions relative to these landmarks across**
**different brains. Hence, only genuine microstructural**
**analysis can define the borders between these cortical**
**areas. Additional significant borders which do not**
**correlate with visible changes in cytoarchitecture can**
**be found within areas 3b and 1. They may represent**
**somatotopy and/or cortical representations of differ-**
**ent somatosensory receptors.** � **[1999 Academic Press]**

**INTRODUCTION**

Several microstructural maps of the human primary
somatosensory cortex (S1) have been published (Brodmann, 1909; Vogt and Vogt, 1919; von Economo and
Koskinas 1925; Bailey and von Bonin 1951; Sarkissov


_et al., 1955; Braak, 1980; White et al., 1997). Most_
authors agree as to the number, microstructural features, and extent of areas within S1 (i.e., areas 3a, 3b,
1, and 2 according to the nomenclature of Brodmann
(1909) and Vogt and Vogt (1919) which is most widely
used). Area 3a lies in the fundus of the central sulcus,
area 3b occupies mainly the rostral bank, area 1
occupies the crown, and area 2 occupies the caudal
bank of the postcentral gyrus. Unfortunately, microstructural maps of different authors vary in many
details. This is due to interindividual variability and
the small number of brains examined in each study
(i.e., the problem of sample size) which should be seen,
however, in the light of the enormous size of the human
brain and the time-consuming and cumbersome procedure of microstructural parcellation. Another problem
is the inherent subjectivity underlying any microstructural parcellation of the cerebral cortex. Up to now, it
has not been possible to define microstructural borders
between cortical areas in an objective and observerindependent way. Instead, numerous subjective factors, e.g., experience and technique of pattern recognition, have influenced the results and introduced a
significant degree of intra- and interobserver variability. This led to a long-standing polemic between two
extreme tenets in the first decades of this century:
those investigators who advocated ‘‘haarscharfe Grenzen’’ (i.e., boundaries as sharp or fine as a hair) between
cortical areas (to paraphrase O. Vogt) and those researchers who interpreted the cortex as a more or less
homogeneous matrix with only minor variations (to
paraphrase P. Bailey and G. von Bonin). Severe criticism of cytoarchitectonic parcellation studies (Lashley
and Clark, 1946) was the consequence.
On the other hand, there is evidence from many
recent electrophysiological studies in S1 of nonhuman
primates that neurons with similar receptive fields and
response properties lie within the same cytoarchitectonic area when the identical brain is sectioned and
cell-stained following recording experiments, and penetration sites are correlated with the cytoarchitectonic

change across cytoarchitectonic borders (Merzenich et
_al., 1978; Kaas et al., 1979; Iwamura et al., 1980,_
1983a,b, 1985, 1993, 1994). Cortical areas which are
different from each other in their cytoarchitectonic
patterns also differ from each other in their electrophysiological properties or, in other words, microstructure
indeed parallels function.
In humans, noninvasive imaging techniques, e.g.,
positron emission tomography (PET), functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), or magnetoencephalography (MEG), functionally parcellate S1 with increasing spatial resolution, but they relate foci of cerebral
activation only to macrostructural landmarks of the
cortex, i.e., gyri and sulci. On the other hand, structural–
functional correlations in primate S1 (see above) and
other cortical regions as well show that cortical areas as
functional entities can be defined as to their location
and extent only microstructurally, e.g., by cytoarchitecture. Unfortunately, most microstructurally defined
interareal borders do not match macrostructural landmarks of the human cortex and are quite variable as to
their location and extent across individuals (Rademacher et al., 1993; Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996; Geyer et
_al., 1995, 1996, 1997; Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic,_
1995; Simon et al., 1995; Morosan et al., 1996; Rademacher et al., 1996; White et al., 1997; Roland et al., 1997;
Zilles et al., 1997; Amunts et al., 1997). For this reason,
structural–functional correlations based only on macrostructure are questionable and may account for at least
some of the conflicting results functional imaging studies have provided in recent years, e.g., the debate
whether (Hallett et al., 1994; Stephan et al., 1995;
Sabbah et al., 1995; Leonardo et al., 1995; Roth et al.,
1996; Porro et al., 1996) or not (Roland et al., 1980; Rao
_et al., 1993; Decety et al., 1994; Sanes, 1994; Parsons et_
_al., 1995) primary sensorimotor cortex is activated_
during imagined movements.
Thus, two things are needed: (i) objective cytoarchitectonic mapping and delineation of cortical areas in order
to avoid subjective evaluation of microstructural differences between areas (including all problems related to
it) and (ii) transfer of these areas into a standardized
3-D reference system on the basis of a computerized
brain atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994) in which they can
be matched with functional data, e.g., from PET, fMRI,
or MEG.
In this study we used a new approach (Schleicher et
_al., 1995, 1999), i.e., a combination of objective delinea-_
tion of cytoarchitectonic borders followed by cytoarchitectonic classification to delineate areas 3a, 3b, and 1 of
human S1 in 10 postmortem brains. As a next step,
these areas will be transformed into the standard
anatomical format of the computerized Human Brain
_Atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994), and corresponding_
areas from different brains will be superimposed in 3-D

**MATERIALS AND METHODS**

_Histological Processing of the Brains_

Cytoarchitectonic analysis was done in 10 postmortem brains obtained at autopsy from subjects with no
known history of neurological or psychiatric diseases (4
male and 6 female, mean age 65.4 years, range 39–85
years; cf. Table 1). All subjects had given written
consent before death and/or had been included in the
body donor program of the Brain Research Institute,
University of Du¨sseldorf, Germany. The brains were
removed from the skull and were fixed in 4% formaldehyde diluted in water or in Bodian’s fixative (90 ml of
80% ethanol, 5 ml of 37% formaldehyde diluted in
water, and 5 ml of glacial acetic acid) for 5 months. The
brains were fixed in a freely floating way, i.e., suspended at the basilar artery, to avoid compression or
distortion during fixation. The arachnoidea was removed after fixation. The brains were then dehydrated
in graded alcohols, embedded in a paraffin block, and
sectioned at 20 µm in a coronal plane with a microtome
for large sections. Sections were mounted on gelatincoated slides and were stained with a modified silver
method (Merker, 1983) which yields Nissl-like, highcontrast staining for cytoarchitectonic analysis


-----

_Cytoarchitectonic Classification_

Rectangular regions of interest (ROI) covering the
caudal bank of the precentral gyrus and the rostral and
caudal banks of the postcentral gyrus were defined in
each selected cell-stained section. These ROIs were
scanned in a mosaic-like sequence with a digital camera (XC-75; Sony, Tokyo, Japan; image matrix 512 � 512
pixels, 8-bit gray value resolution) attached to a microscope (Universal microscope; Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany) which was equipped with a computer-controlled
motorized stage. The images (square microscopical
field 550 µm across) were transferred to a computer and
further processed with an image analysis software
package (KS 400; Zeiss). In each image, the areal
fraction of darkly stained cell bodies was measured
after adaptive thresholding (Schleicher and Zilles, 1990)
in square, adjoining fields 25 µm wide. This areal
fraction [gray level index (GLI)] is highly correlated
with the volume density of neurons (Wree et al., 1982).
Glial and endothelial cells are equally distributed
throughout the layers of the cortex and are therefore an
additive, yet constant, contribution to the volume density of neurons. The GLI was measured in each field
within each image; the resulting data matrix covering
the entire ROI is the GLI image. Variations in staining
intensities of cell bodies and/or background do not
influence the GLI image because the GLI is extracted
from binary images. For further details see Schleicher
and Zilles (1990).
Equidistant density profiles [125 µm wide; spacing
between adjacent profiles 300 µm (for low spatial
resolution) or 150 µm (for high resolution)] covering the
entire ROI were extracted from the GLI images perpendicularly to a central line between layers I/II and layer
VI/white matter. Profiles extended from the border
between layers I and II to the border between layer VI
and white matter. An outer (between layers I and II)
and inner (between layer VI and white matter) contour
line was defined interactively in each GLI image with a
graphics tablet. The central line between both contour
lines was calculated with a skeleton algorithm, and
equidistant profiles (spacing along the central line 300
or 150 µm) were automatically extracted from the GLI
image. Each profile was oriented perpendicularly to the
central line, and extended from the outer to the inner
contour line.
Profiles were standardized to a length of 101 GLI
values (corresponding to a cortical depth of 100%) by
resampling the data with linear interpolation in order
to compensate for variations in cortical thickness.
Profile shapes were quantified by extracting 10 features (mean y, mean x, standard deviation of x, skewness, kurtosis) from each standardized profile and from
the absolute value of its first derivative and were
combined into one feature vector X The data from the


_z-scores in order to assign equal weight to each of the_
features. A mean feature vector X1 was calculated from
a block of b1 adjacent profiles (8 � _b1 �_ 20) and another
mean feature vector X2 from a neighboring block of
_b2 adjacent profiles (8 �_ _b2 �_ 20; b1 � _b2). The Mahala-_
nobis distance (Mahalanobis et al., 1949) D[2] �
(X1 � **X2)�C[�][1]** (X1 � **X2) was calculated from the mean**
vectors and the inverse of the pooled covariance matrix
**C[�][1]. D[2]** values were plotted as a function of the
positions of the profile blocks relative to the cortex (see
Fig. 3). The resulting distance function revealed maxima
at locations at which regions covered by profiles showed
marked differences in laminar patterns. Statistical
significance was established by calculating Hotelling’s
statistic T[2] � (D [2]/(1/b1 � 1/b2)) (b1 � _b2, the number of_
profiles per block). The corresponding p values were
Bonferroni corrected for multiple comparisons. The
number of profiles per block b defined the spatial
resolution of this procedure, i.e., only cytoarchitectonic
entities wider than the cortical sector covered by one
block of profiles could be resolved with correct distance
values. For this reason, significant maxima of the
distance function D[2] were defined in the following way:
(1) Maxima with p � 0.05 were discarded. (2) If the
distance between two adjacent maxima was equal to or
smaller than one block of profiles, the maximum with
the higher p value was discarded. The procedure converged after a second pass of step (2). The remaining
maxima were termed ‘‘main maxima.’’ For each ROI,
distance functions were calculated for b � 8 to b � 20,
and positions of main maxima were plotted as a function of b (see Figs. 4, 8, and 10). For further details see
Schleicher et al. (1999). The positions of these main
maxima were compared with the visible cytoarchitectonic pattern in the cell-stained sections.
A discriminant analysis was performed for each
sample of n profiles per ROI to analyze differences in
shapes between those groups of profiles which had been
extracted from areas 4, 3a, 3b, 1, and 2. The result of
each analysis was plotted using the first two canonical
variables (see Fig. 12). These variables are the x- and
_y-axes of a plane which shows most clearly differences_
between groups of profiles sampled from the five areas.

**RESULTS**

Two examples of cell-stained coronal whole brain
sections from two different brains (comparable levels in
the rostrocaudal direction) are shown in Fig. 1 [brain
207/84, section 3301 (Fig. 1A), and brain 544/91, section
3241 (Fig. 1B)]. Boxes show ROIs covering the caudal
bank of the precentral gyrus (pr) and the rostral and
caudal banks of the postcentral gyrus (po) which were
used for GLI measurements and subsequent extraction
of profiles The ROI from brain 207/84 section 3301

low cell density, and a blurred border between gray and

border between gray and white matter in the postcentral gyrus. The border (arrowhead) lies in the caudal
bank of the precentral gyrus close to the fundus of the
central sulcus. The corresponding GLI image is shown

**FIG. 3.** One set of profiles (brain 207/84, section 3361) is processed for different numbers of adjacent profiles per block to show the effect of
increasing values of b (smoothing effect): b1 � _b2 �_ 9 (A), b1 � _b2 �_ 12 (B), b1 � _b2 �_ 15 (C), and b1 � _b2 �_ 18 (D). Values of the Mahalanobis
distance function (ordinate) are plotted against positions of the profile blocks relative to the cortex (abscissa). Main maxima are marked with
dotted lines. Symbols indicate levels of significance. Bars indicate widths of one block of profiles which define the spatial resolution. See
Materials and Methods for further details.


ing values of b (i.e., smoothing) is demonstrated by
processing the same profiles for different numbers of
adjacent profiles per block (b1,b2): b1 � _b2 �_ 9 (Fig. 3A),
_b1 �_ _b2 �_ 12 (Fig. 3B), b1 � _b2 �_ 15 (Fig. 3C), and b1 �
_b2 �_ 18 (Fig. 3D). Main maxima are marked with dotted
lines. Symbols indicate levels of significance. Note that
the degree of smoothing increases with higher numbers
of profiles per block. The positions of several main
maxima, however, do not seem to be influenced by the
block size being used: they can be reproduced at similar
positions in the cortex. The maximum at position 21 in
Fig. 3A seems to correspond to maxima 17 in Fig. 3B, 19
in Fig. 3C, and 21 in Fig. 3D. Additional corresponding
maxima seem to be present at positions (in Figs. 3A to
3D) 73–66–66–73, 97–110–101–104, and 130–130–126–
130 Positions of significant maxima are plotted against


blocksizes from b � 8 to b � 20 in Fig. 4 (section 3361;
Fig. 4C; dotted vertical line ‘‘A’’ corresponds to Fig. 3A,
line ‘‘B’’ to Fig. 3B, etc.). With increasing b-values some
main maxima are eliminated, but others can be reproduced at comparable positions across a wide range of
block sizes especially toward higher b-values, i.e., the
maxima at positions 21, 73, 104, and 130 (Fig. 4C).
Comparable maxima can be found at similar positions
in a series of nearby sections from the same brain (Fig.
4): in section 3421 (1.2 mm further rostral than section
3361; Fig. 4A) at positions 20, 85, 115, and 149 (cf. Fig.
5A); in section 3301 (1.2 mm further caudal than
section 3361; Fig. 4E) at positions 20, 76, and 131 (cf.
Fig. 5E); and in section 3241 (2.4 mm further caudal
than section no. 3361; Fig. 4G) at positions 20, 78, 104,
and 128 (cf Fig 5G)

with visible changes in cytoarchitecture in order to
further elucidate the nature of the microstructural
entities delineated by these borders. The maxima at
positions 20 (Fig. 5A), 21 (Fig. 5C), 20 (Fig. 5E), and 20
(Fig. 5G) lie in the caudal bank of the precentral gyrus
close to the fundus of the central sulcus. The cytoarchitectonic pattern in this region (Fig. 6A) reveals a wide
band of gray matter, low cell density, a pronounced
columnar arrangement of the cells, and a blurred
border between gray and white matter in the precentral gyrus (left) versus a narrow band of gray matter,
high cell density, an incipient layer IV, and a sharp
border between gray and white matter in the postcentral gyrus (right). The position of the border between
primary motor area 4 and primary somatosensory area
3 is marked and matches very closely the corresponding
borders defined in an objective way. The maxima at
positions 85 (Fig. 5A), 73 (Fig. 5C), 76 (Fig. 5E), and 78
(Fig. 5G) lie in the superficial part of the rostral bank of
the postcentral gyrus. The cytoarchitectonic pattern in
this region (Fig. 7A) shows typical granular cortex with
high cell density (left) versus lower cell density, a more
pronounced columnar arrangement of the cells, and
fairly large and elongated pyramidal cells in lower
layer III (right). The position of the border between
primary somatosensory areas 3 and 1 is marked and
again matches very closely the corresponding borders
defined objectively. Maxima 115 (Fig. 5A), 104 (Fig. 5C),
and 104 (Fig. 5G) lie at comparable positions on the
crown of the postcentral gyrus. Subjective analysis
reveals no visible change in cytoarchitecture at this
position. Maxima 149 (Fig. 5A), 130 (Fig. 5C), 131 (Fig.
5E), and 128 (Fig. 5G) lie at comparable positions in the
caudal bank of the postcentral gyrus. The cytoarchitectonic pattern in this region (Fig. 7B) again shows fairly
large and elongated lower layer III pyramids which are
characteristic of area 1 (right) versus slightly lower cell
density and much smaller lower layer III pyramids
(left). The position of the border between areas 1 and 2
is marked and again matches very closely the corresponding borders defined in an observer-independent
way.
According to the literature, area 3 can be further
subdivided into areas 3a and 3b. The algorithm did not
detect any subdivisions within area 3 which might
suggest the existence of areas 3a or 3b. However, the
spatial extent of area 3a is very small (it lies in the
fundus of the central sulcus), and the spatial resolution
of the algorithm is governed not only by the block size
being used but also by the distance (in µm) between
adjacent profiles. For this reason, a ROI covering the
fundal region of the central sulcus in each section
(shaded regions in Figs. 4A, 4C, 4E, and 4G) was
rescanned with higher spatial resolution (i.e., equidistant profiles were extracted 150 µm apart instead of


respectively. The maxima at positions 20 (Figs. 5B, 5D,
5F, and 5H) lie in the caudal bank of the precentral
gyrus close to the fundus of the central sulcus and
correspond to the border between area 4 and area 3.
The maxima at positions 58 (Fig. 5B), 67 (Fig. 5D), 51
(Fig. 5F), and 38 (Fig. 5H) lie at comparable positions in
the postcentral gyrus close to the fundus of the central
sulcus. The cytoarchitectonic pattern in this region
(Fig. 6B) shows granular cortex with somewhat lower
cell density, a more pronounced columnar arrangement
of the cells, and medium-sized pyramids scattered
throughout lower layer III and layer V (left) versus
high cell density, no columnar arrangement, and absent medium-sized pyramids (right). The position of the
border between areas 3a and 3b is marked and matches
very closely the corresponding borders defined objectively.
Figures 8–11 show the degree of interindividual
variability of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 and their correlation
with macroscopical landmarks (i.e., gyri and sulci) in
eight different brains. One coronal section per brain
from a comparable rostrocaudal level was scanned in
the same way as described above, i.e., the caudal bank
of the precentral and the postcentral gyrus with equidistant profiles 300 µm apart and in addition a ROI
covering the fundus of the central sulcus with equidistant profiles 150 µm apart. Positions of significant
maxima are plotted against blocksizes in Figs. 8 and 10.
Shaded regions in Figs. 8A, 8C, 8E, 8G, 10A, 10C, 10E,
and 10G indicate ROIs which were rescanned with
equidistant profiles 150 µm apart (results are shown in
Figs. 8B, 8D, 8F, 8H, 10B, 10D, 10F, and 10H). Again,
some main maxima are eliminated with increasing
values of b, but others can be reproduced at comparable
positions across a wide range of block sizes. Their
positions closely match the cytoarchitectonic transitions between areas 4/3a, 3a/3b, 3b/1, and 1/2 as shown
in Figs. 6 and 7. At some positions, however, visual
analysis reveals no appreciable change in the cytoarchitectonic pattern. The resulting areal maps are shown in
Figs. 9 and 11. At position 41 in brain 382/81, section
3751 (Fig. 11E), and position 42 in brain 56/94, section
3361 (Fig. 11G), borders are detected in low-resolution
mode (i.e., equidistant profiles 300 µm apart) which can
be reproduced at corresponding positions in highresolution mode (i.e., equidistant profiles 150 µm apart;
cf. Figs. 11F and 11H, respectively) and which, upon
visual inspection, closely match the cytoarchitectonic
transition between areas 3a and 3b as shown in Fig. 6B.
Note that the spatial extent of area 3a parallel to the
cortical layers is maximal in these two brains [in
high-resolution mode between positions 19 and 67 � 48
profiles in brain 382/81 (Fig. 11F) and between positions 20 and 70 � 50 profiles in brain 56/94 (Fig 11H)]

207/84, section 3421 (A); brain 2/95, section 4261 (B); brain 382/81, section 3751 (C); and brain 56/94, section 3361 (D). Open symbols represent
single profiles; shaded regions represent 95% confidence areas of each group’s centroid.


All the profiles sampled in low-resolution mode from
one section were grouped into five classes (i.e., belonging to areas 4, 3a, 3b, 1, or 2) based on this definition of
interareal borders. A discriminant analysis was then
performed for each section. The result of each analysis
is graphically presented by using the first two canonical
variables (Fig. 12). Four different brains are shown, one
section per brain. In the sections from brains 207/84
and 2/95 (Figs. 12A and 12B), area 3a is too small to be
detected in low-resolution mode (cf. Figs. 5A and 11C).
In the sections from brains 382/81 and 56/94 (Figs. 12C
and 12D) area 3a is large enough to be detected in low

resolution mode (cf. Figs. 11E and 11G). Symbols
represent single profiles; shaded regions represent 95%
confidence areas of each group’s centroid. In each
section, differences in profile shapes between the five
cortical areas result in clusters without any overlap
among the 95% confidence areas.
All ROIs shown were sampled from right hemispheres
and from comparable rostrocaudal levels. Two findings are
obvious in all brains: Cytoarchitectonic interareal borders
do not match macrostructural landmarks of the postcentral gyrus, and they vary considerably in their positions
relative to these landmarks across different brains


-----

In this study we mapped human primary somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1 by using a combination of
objective and observer-independent delineation of cytoarchitectonic borders followed by cytoarchitectonic classification. Cytoarchitectonic mapping of the human
somatosensory cortex has been done several times in
the past (Campbell, 1905; Brodmann, 1909; von
Economo and Koskinas, 1925; Bailey and von Bonin,
1951; Sarkissov et al., 1955; White et al., 1997). Our
mapping approach, however, is new in so far as cytoar_chitectonic borders can be defined in an objective way._
This obviates subjective evaluation of differences in the
cytoarchitectonic pattern (and all problems related to
it) which has so far been the only way to structurally
define cortical areas. As a second step, it is necessary to
_interpret and classify these cytoarchitectonic entities_
which implies a certain degree of subjectivity, e.g.,
when correlating the cytoarchitectonic features of these
entities with verbal or pictorial descriptions published
in the literature.
Hence, the whole procedure implies two steps: (i)
objective definition of cytoarchitectonic borders, followed by (ii) interpretation and classification of the
cytoarchitectonic entities surrounded by these borders.

_Objective Definition of Cytoarchitectonic Borders_

The approach is based on the assumption that microstructural entities of the cerebral cortex are characterized by a specific cytoarchitectonic pattern which differs from that of neighboring entities. Density profiles
extracted perpendicularly to the pial surface across
cortical layers II–VI quantify this cytoarchitectonic
pattern. Maximum differences in profile shapes can be
expected when two groups of profiles sampled from two
different entities are compared. Although each profile is
125 µm wide, single profiles are affected by local
structural inhomogeneities, e.g., cell clusters or blood
vessels. Thus, in order to smooth the signal, and
improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the distance function, two adjacent groups of profiles were compared
instead of two adjacent single profiles (see also Schleicher et al., 1999).
Many main maxima of the Mahalanobis distance
function are fairly sharp peaks, especially toward
smaller block sizes (cf. Fig. 3). This, however, should
not be interpreted as an emerging renaissance of the
Vogts’discussions on ‘‘haarscharfe Grenzen’’(i.e., boundaries as sharp or fine as a hair). The photographs show
that there is always a more or less wide transition zone
around a cytoarchitectonic border in which the cytoarchitectonic pattern of one entity merges into the pattern of the adjacent entity. Main maxima define that
point in each transition zone where the degree of


is maximal (see also Schleicher et al., 1999).
Other factors may also influence the shapes of profiles and may be responsible for additional significant
maxima. Variations in staining intensity of cell bodies
or background within a section, across different sections, and across different brains are a critical issue.
This problem, however, is irrelevant in our study
because the profiles were extracted not from digitized
images of the cell-stained sections but instead from GLI
images in which cell bodies have been segmented from
the background by adaptive thresholding (Schleicher
and Zilles, 1990; cf. Fig. 2A with 2B in which local
variations in staining intensity of the background,
marked with asterisks in Fig. 2A, are absent). Artifacts
due to sectioning of the tissue (e.g., tears) are a major
problem when analyzing large or even whole brain
sections as was done in this study. However, one should
keep in mind that the number of profiles per block (b1,
_b2) limits the spatial resolution of the algorithm (from_
_b �_ 8 � 300 µm � 2.4 mm to b � 20 � 300 µm � 6 mm
in low-resolution mode or from 1.2 to 3 mm in highresolution mode). Only entities wider than a cortical
sector covered by one block of profiles can be resolved
with correct distance values. Small artifacts are irrelevant. As soon as their length parallel to the cortical
layers exceeds the threshold of spatial resolution, they
are a potential source of false-positive borders. The
artifact on the crown of the postcentral gyrus shown in
Figs. 2A and 2B (arrows) measures around 2.5 mm
parallel to the cortical layers and lies approximately at
the threshold of spatial resolution for small values of b
(low-resolution mode). In addition, artifacts are usually
distributed randomly throughout the cortex, and this
should become evident when comparing a series of
consecutive sections. Cortical arteries and veins rarely
exceed 200 µm in diameter and they are oriented more
or less perpendicularly to the cortical layers. Smaller
vessels arise from the principal trunk and spread out at
different angles but their length parallel to the cortical
layers does not reach the threshold of spatial resolution
(Duvernoy et al., 1981). Cortical columns or modules
are a basic structural and functional principle of the
cerebral cortex. In the somatosensory cortex, each
column is 300–400 µm wide and contains approximately 80 minicolumns of 50–60 µm in diameter
(Mountcastle, 1997). Hence, cortical columns and minicolumns do not reach the threshold of spatial resolution. In gyrencephalic brains, inward and outward folds
of the cortex cause distortions of the cytoarchitectonic
pattern (cf., e.g., Van Essen, 1997). In order to assess to
what extent cortical folding causes false-positive borders, a model of a layered cortical region was generated
(Schleicher et al., 1999). In this study, five layers were
represented by horizontal stripes with different GLI
values and random noise was added Interareal bor

-----

ing step-like changes in GLI values oriented perpendicularly to the stripes. In addition, a low frequency sineshaped thinning of layer II was inserted which
represents a distortion in the thickness of layers II and
III induced by cortical folding. The distance function
detected all borders with sharp and significant maxima
but not the sine-shaped distortion (Schleicher et al.,
1999). In addition, Figs. 5, 9, and 11 of the present
study show that those positions at which the curvature
of the cortex is maximal (e.g., fundi of sulci) do not
coincide with positions of main maxima.

_Interpretation and Classification_
_of the Cytoarchitectonic Entities Surrounded_
_by These Borders_

The next step is to interpret and classify the cytoarchitectonic entities surrounded by these borders. The
positions of several borders closely match transitions in
the cytoarchitectonic pattern which are readily visible.
The first complete cytoarchitectonic map of the human
brain by Campbell (1905) defined only two areas in the
postcentral gyrus, a ‘‘postcentral’’ and an ‘‘intermediate
postcentral’’ area. The former occupies mainly the
rostral half, and the latter the caudal half of the
postcentral gyrus. The most famous cytoarchitectonic
map, still widely used today, is the map of Brodmann.
He described one area in the caudal wall of the precentral gyrus (area 4) and three areas in the postcentral
gyrus (area 3 in the rostral wall, area 1 on the crown,
and area 2 in the caudal wall). Unfortunately,
Brodmann’s publications (1903, 1908, 1909) are not
very helpful as they do not contain detailed morphological descriptions of the areas and also lack photographic
illustrations. He only briefly comments on the topographic localization of each area, and the map is just a
sketch showing each area’s extent on the free cortical
surface only. In addition to areas 3, 1, and 2, Brodmann
described a small transition zone in the rostral part of
area 3, located in the fundus of the central sulcus, and
characterized by scattered large pyramidal cells and an
internal granular layer. Later, Vogt and Vogt (1919)
termed this region ‘‘area 3a.’’ In contrast to Brodmann,
von Economo and Koskinas (1925) meticulously described each area’s cytoarchitectonic features and also
included photomicrographs. They delineated one area
in the caudal wall of the precentral gyrus: area FA,
being characterized by low cell density, absent layer IV,
and giant pyramidal cells in layer V. Area FA seems to
correspond to Brodmann’s area 4. Four areas were
defined in the postcentral gyrus: areas PA, PB, PC, and
PD. An emerging layer IV and medium-sized pyramids
in lower layer III and layer V characterize area PA
which lies in the fundus of the central sulcus. Most
probably, it corresponds to area 3a of Brodmann and
Vogt and Vogt Area PB lies in the rostral wall of the


in layers III and V are missing. It seems to correspond
to area 3b of Brodmann and Vogt and Vogt. Area PC
occupies the crown of the postcentral gyrus and is
characterized by large pyramidal cells in lower layer
III. It seems to correspond to Brodmann’s area 1. Area
PD lies in the caudal wall of the postcentral gyrus. The
prominent band of lower layer III pyramids is missing.
Area PD most probably corresponds to Brodmann’s
area 2. Bailey and von Bonin (1951) defined only two
regions in the postcentral gyrus: a band lying in the
rostral wall which they termed ‘‘koniocortex’’and ‘‘parakoniocortex’’ occupying crown and caudal wall of the
gyrus. The last complete cytoarchitectonic map of the
human cortex by Sarkissov and co-workers (1955) is to
some extent a synopsis of Brodmann’s and the Vogt and
Vogt’s work. Similar to Brodmann, they delineated
three areas: area 3 in the rostral wall, area 1 on the
crown, and area 2 in the caudal wall of the postcentral
gyrus. A recent cytoarchitectonic study of the primary
sensorimotor cortex (White et al., 1997) adopted the
Brodmann/Vogt nomenclature and mapped areas 3a,
3b, and 1. Extent and cytoarchitectonic features of area
3a match those of area PA according to von Economo
and Koskinas (1925); area 3b corresponds to area PB,
and area 1 to area PC.
In our sample of sections, low cell density and an
absent layer IV can be found in the caudal bank of the
precentral gyrus. Size and packing density of the giant
pyramidal or Betz cells greatly varies across human
brains (unpublished observations). They are fairly small
and inconspicuous in the photograph shown here (cf.
Fig. 6A). These features disappear around profile 20 in
section 3421, brain 207/84 (Fig. 5A), and at corresponding positions in nearby sections. This corresponds to
area 4. The prominent band of lower layer III pyramids
emerges around profile 85 (same section) and disappears around profile 149. The entity in between is most
likely area 1. Further caudally, lower layer III pyramids are much smaller. Cytoarchitecture and topography classify the entity caudal from profile 149 as, most
probably, area 2. High cell density and layer IV classify
the entity between profiles 20 and 85 as area 3.
According to the literature (see above), area 3 can be
further subdivided into areas 3a and 3b. In some brains
(e.g., 207/84 or 189/92) the algorithm (in low-resolution
mode) did not detect any subdivisions within area 3
which might suggest the existence of areas 3a or 3b. In
some other brains (e.g., 544/91 or 281/93) the algorithm
(in low-resolution mode) detected borders approximately in the middle of area 3. Could this be the border
between areas 3a and 3b? Several lines of evidence
suggest that this is probably not so. First, an area
3a-like cytoarchitectonic entity has so far been described several times by different investigators in different brains and across the whole dorsomedial to


-----

investigators described area 3a as a small area lying in
the fundus of the central sulcus, and they put the area
3a/3b border not far away from the fundus in the
ascending part of the postcentral gyrus. The borders
approximately in the middle of area 3 would suggest an
unusually large extent of area 3a. Third, there are
visible cytoarchitectonic differences between areas 3a
and 3b (see above). However, no visible changes in
cytoarchitecture are obvious at these borders in the
middle of area 3. The most probable explanation that
area 3a has been missed in low-resolution mode in most
brains is indeed the small spatial extent of area 3a. An
entity as small as area 3a in its classical description
(see above) may easily escape detection, especially
toward larger block sizes. However, the spatial resolution of the algorithm is governed not only by the block
size being used but also by the distance (in µm) between
adjacent profiles. For this reason, a ROI covering the
fundal region of the central sulcus was rescanned with
higher spatial resolution (i.e., equidistant profiles 150
µm apart instead of 300 µm). This procedure reliably
detected borders within area 3 not far away from the
fundus of the central sulcus in the ascending part of the
postcentral gyrus in all brains. In addition, visible
changes in cytoarchitecture are obvious at these borders (cf. Fig. 6B) which correspond to the transition
between areas 3a and 3b published in the literature
(see above). If the spatial extent of area 3a parallel to
the cortical layers exceeds a certain threshold, the
3a/3b border can also be detected in low-resolution
mode (and confirmed in high-resolution mode; cf. brains
382/81 and 56/94). In any case, a discriminant analysis
based on this definition of the borders between areas 4,
3a, 3b, 1, and 2 confirmed this classification: five
clusters of profiles were obtained without any overlap
among the 95% confidence areas.
Another question is the nature of the remaining
borders which do not correlate with visible changes in
cytoarchitecture. Research mainly on nonhuman primates demonstrates that each of the four primary
somatosensory areas contains an independent systematic representation of body receptors, corresponding to
the well-known somatotopic arrangement: dorsomedial
� lower extremity = ventrolateral � oral cavity. The
somatotopic maps of areas 3b and 1 are those which are
most precise and detailed (Merzenich et al., 1978, 1987;
Kaas et al., 1979; Nelson et al., 1980; Sur et al., 1982;
Felleman et al., 1983; Cusick et al., 1986). Furthermore, area 3b contains two mosaic-like interdigitated
maps, one for slowly adapting and one for rapidly
adapting inputs (Sur et al., 1981, 1984). These somatotopic maps of primate S1 have been defined with
electrophysiological techniques, i.e., microelectrode recordings. A recent publication showed for the first time
in primate S1 that somatotopy is also reflected on a


myelin. A mediolateral row of five ovals, separated by
myelin-light septa, represented digits and corresponded precisely with cortical sites activated by light
touch on individual digits in microelectrode recordings.
A more distinct septum separated the hand from the
more lateral face representation which could be subdivided into two large myelin-dense ovals that were
activated by the upper or lower face in a caudorostral
sequence (Jain et al., 1998). The borders within areas 3
and 1 which do not correlate with visible changes in
cytoarchitecture may represent cytoarchitectonic
equivalents of the fine grained functional organization
within areas 3 and 1, i.e., somatotopy and/or cortical
representations of different somatosensory receptors.
The cytoarchitectonic borders between these entities
(note that the study mentioned above used sections
stained for myelin) may be so subtle that they can only
be resolved with observer-independent techniques. [A
technical note: in the sequence of sections from brain
207/84, border 115 in section 3421 most probably
corresponds to border 104 in section 3361 and to border
104 in section 3241. A corresponding maximum is
missing in section 3301, possibly due to the artifact on
the crown of the postcentral gyrus (cf. Fig. 2)].

_Interindividual Variability—Implications for_
_Functional Imaging Studies_

Two findings of this study are very important for
correctly interpreting data from functional imaging
studies. First, cytoarchitectonic borders do not match
macrostructural landmarks of the postcentral gyrus,
i.e., there are no dimples, notches, or grooves which
mark borders between cortical areas and which might
be visible on high-resolution MR scans. Second, these
borders vary considerably in their positions relative to
macrostructural landmarks across different brains.
Hence, only genuine microstructural analysis can define borders between cortical areas.
Therefore, as a next step, these areas will be transformed into the standard anatomical format of the
computerized Human Brain Atlas (Roland and Zilles,
1994), and corresponding areas from different brains
will be superimposed in 3-D space to show the degree of
interindividual microstructural variability in a standardized 3-D reference system. On this basis, genuine
microstructural data can be matched with functional
PET or fMRI data (i.e., microstructural-functional correlation on a probabilistic basis).
