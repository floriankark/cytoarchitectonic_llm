Abstract The microstructural correlates of the functional

segregation of the human lateral occipital cortex are largely
unknown. Therefore, we analyzed the cytoarchitecture of
this region in ten human post-mortem brains using an observer-independent and statistically testable parcellation
method to define the position and extent of areas in the
lateral occipital cortex. Two new cytoarchitectonic areas
were found: an anterior area hOc4la and a posterior area
hOc4lp. hOc4la was located behind the anterior occipital
sulcus in rostral and ventral portions of this region where it
occupies the anterior third of the middle and inferior lateral
occipital gyri. hOc4lp was found in caudal and dorsal

portions of this region where it extends along the superior
and middle lateral occipital gyri. The cytoarchitectonic
areas were registered to 3D reconstructions of the corresponding brains, which were subsequently spatially normalized to the Montreal Neurological Institute reference
space. Continuous probabilistic maps of both areas based
on the analysis of ten brains were generated to characterize
their inter-subject variability in location and size. The maps
of hOc4la and hOc4lp were then used as seeds for metaanalytic connectivity modeling and quantitative functional
decoding to identify their co-activation patterns and assignment to functional domains. Convergent evidence from
their location, topography, size, functional domains and
connectivity indicates that hOc4la and hOc4lp are the potential anatomical correlates of the functionally defined
lateral occipital areas LO-1 and LO-2.

Introduction

The human lateral occipital cortex represents a broad region interposed between visual area V5/MT located anteriorly, and visual areas V3 (V3d and V3v) and V3A both
located posteriorly. Functional imaging studies demonstrated that this region is involved in visual object perception and visual motion processing. Rostral and ventral
parts of this region are functionally defined as lateral occipital complex (LO or LOC), that responds preferentially
to images of objects, independent of the particular image
features that define the object shape (e.g., luminance,
contrast, motion and texture) (Grill-Spector et al. 2001;

Kourtzi and Kanwisher 2001; Larsson and Heeger 2006;
Malach et al. 1995; Sarkheil et al. 2008; Vinberg and GrillSpector 2008). Furthermore, LOC may be subdivided by its
responses to the location and size of objects (Grill-Spector
et al. 1999; Sawamura et al. 2005), to differences in perceived 3D object shape (Kourtzi et al. 2003; Murray et al.
2003), to familiar objects and abstract 2D shapes (Stanley
and Rubin 2005), and to intact images of common objects
(Larsson and Heeger 2006). Caudal and dorsal parts of
human LOC are specialized in the processing of kinetic
contours (boundaries) that combine both shape and motion
information (Dupont et al. 1997; Grossman et al. 2000;
Kononen et al. 2003; Tootell and Hadjikhani 2001; Van
Oostende et al. 1997) and respond to second-order motion
(Smith et al. 1998). In the first case, this cortical region is
referred as the kinetic occipital region (KO); while in the
second case, it is indicated as a motion-sensitive area V3B.
There are two alternative views related to the function of
KO. According to the first view, KO is considered to be a
region specialized in contour processing in general, rather
than in specialized processing of kinetic contours that define the object shape (Zeki et al. 2003). According to the
second view, KO represents the cortical region that includes multiple visual areas (V3, V3B, LO-1, LO-2), rather
than a single entity specialized in the processing of kinetic
contours (Larsson et al. 2010).
Retinotopic mapping of the human lateral occipital
cortex is a highly successful approach to study its segregation (Sereno et al. 1995; Wandell et al. 2007). In the
LOC, Smith et al. (1998) described a topographic representation of the lower quadrant of the contralateral visual
field, area V3B, in a cortical region adjacent to visual area
V3A. Later, both, the upper and lower quadrants of the
visual field were identified in V3B (Press et al. 2001).
Eccentricity-based mapping has shown that some regions
within the LOC are more responsive to the fovea, while
others are more responsive to the periphery of the visual
field. Tootell and Hadjikhani (2001) subdivided the lateral
occipital cortex into two regions representing the central
(LOC) and peripheral (LOP) visual field, respectively. This
was confirmed by Seiffert et al. (2003). The study of
Larsson and Heeger (2006) demonstrated the existence of
two separate topographic representations of the contralateral visual hemifield in LOC. They described a posterior
(LO-1) and an anterior (LO-2) lateral occipital area in the
human brain. Retinotopic representation in LO-1 was the
mirror of that in V3, while that in LO-2 was the mirror of
that in LO-1. The borders between these areas represent the
lower (V3/LO-1) and upper (LO-1/LO-2) vertical meridian. These and the studies of Swisher et al. (2007),
Wandell et al. (2007), Kolster et al. (2010) and Henriksson
et al. (2012) have established LO-1 and LO-2 as distinct,
functionally defined areas within the higher lateral

extrastriate human visual cortex. Furthermore, recent
studies have demonstrated functional differences between
LO-1 and LO-2. LO-2 but not LO-1 contains objectselective representations (Sayres and Grill-Spector 2008),
and LO-2 but not LO-1 overlaps with body part-selective
regions (Weiner and Grill-Spector 2011). Comparisons
between functional maps and myelin-based contrast detected by MRI indicated a close relation between functional
and structural partitioning in many regions of the visual
cortex, but also some interesting differences, which require
further evaluations of both approaches (Abdollahi et al.
2014; Glasser and Van Essen 2011; Glasser et al. 2014).
The functional specialization and distinct retinopic organization of the human LOC provide strong evidence for a
cytoarchitectonic segregation of this region. To test this
hypothesis, we analyzed the cytoarchitecture of the LOC
region in 10 human post-mortem brains using an observerindependent parcellation method (Schleicher et al. 1999,
2000, 2005). We found two distinct lateral occipital cytoarchitectonic areas: an anterior (hOc4la) and a posterior
(hOc4lp) area. We defined their borders, extents, relationships to the occipital sulci and gyri, volumes and stereotaxic locations. Furthermore, principal component and
hierarchical cluster analyses suggest a hierarchically high
position of both areas together with the fusiform areas FG1
and FG2 and a position between the dorsal and ventral
visual streams. Subsequently, we performed meta-analytic
connectivity modeling as well as quantitative functional
decoding of both regions to identify functional correlates of
hOc4la and hOc4lp.

Materials and methods

Post-mortem sample and histological processing

Cytoarchitectonic analysis of the LOC was performed in 10
human post-mortem brains (5 male and 5 female; mean age
66.3 years, age range 37–85 years; post-mortem delay less
than 24 h; Table 1). The brains were obtained from the
body donor program of the Institute of Anatomy, University of Du¨sseldorf, Germany from subjects with no clinical
history of neurological or psychiatric diseases, with the
exception of brain number 3, which came from a subject
with a transitory motor impairment. The same post-mortem
sample was analyzed in previous cytoarchitectonic studies
of visual areas (Amunts et al. 2000; Caspers et al. 2013;
Kujovic et al. 2013; Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy et al.
2007).
The brains were removed from the skull and fixed for
several months in either 4 % formalin or Bodian’s fixative. During fixation, the brains were suspended on the
vertebral arteries in the fixative solution to avoid

compression or major distortions. After fixation and prior
to embedding and sectioning, MR imaging of each postmortem brain was performed using a Simens 1.5 T
Magnetron scanner (Erlangen, Germany) with T1weighted 3D FLASH sequence (flip angle 40�, repetition
time TR = 40 ms, echo time TE = 5 ms). This procedure
provided a reference data set to correct the distortions of
brain shape and size that inevitably occur during histological processing.
After MR imaging, the brains were dehydrated in a
graded series of increasing ethanol concentration, embedded in paraffin, and continuous serial whole brain sections
(about 6–8000 sections per brain) were obtained (coronal
sections, thickness 20 lm). During sectioning, block-face
images after each 15th section were registered using a CCD
camera. Sections were mounted on glass slides and the cell
bodies were stained using a modified silver staining
method (Merker 1983). Every 60th coronal section of each
brain’s entire histological series was digitized, and subjected to cytoarchitectonic analysis resulting in a distance
of 1.2 mm between analyzed sections. The MR sequences
of the fixed brain, the block-face images, and the digitized
histological sections were used to create 3D reconstructed
histological volumes of each brain, corrected for distortions
by registration to the MR volume of the respective brain
(e.g., Amunts et al. 2000).

Nomenclature

The nomenclature of the cytoarchitectonic areas is distinct
from functionally based nomenclatures to indicate the
methodological basis (cytoarchitecture), the species (h
indicates human brain) and the topography (Oc-occipital
lobe, number ‘‘4’’ the fourth area when moving rostrally
from the primary visual area (BA 17/V1/hOc1), letter ‘‘l’’
lateral, while ‘‘a’’ and ‘‘p’’ indicate anterior and posterior
locations).


Observer-independent and statistically testable
detection of cytoarchitectonic borders

The borders between cytoarchitectonic areas were defined
using an algorithm-based approach introduced by Schleicher et al. (1999, 2000, 2005). The cytoarchitecture was
analyzed in cortical regions of interest (ROIs) along the
surface of the LOC. The ROIs were partially surrounded at
the rostral extent by area hOc5 (Malikovic et al. 2007)
located immediately behind the anterior occipital sulcus, at
the dorsal side by areas hOc3d and hOc4d (Kujovic et al.
2013) related to the superior occipital and transverse occipital sulcus, and at the ventral part by areas hOc3v and
hOc4v (Rottschy et al. 2007) closely related to the inferior
occipital sulcus (Figs. 1, 2a, b, 4a).
The ROIs were defined in histological sections and
scanned using a microscope (Zeiss, Germany) with a motorized scanning stage and a CCD camera (Sony, Tokyo,
Japan) resulting in an in-plane resolution of 1 lm per pixel.
The digitized sections were transformed to gray level index
(GLI) images using a KS400[�] image analyzing system
(Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany). The gray level index
quantifies the volume fraction of cell bodies for each
measuring field (Schleicher and Zilles 1990; Wree et al.
1982) (Figs. 2, 3). The size of each measuring field was
17 9 17 lm. The GLI images were further used to generate GLI profiles.
The GLI profiles were extracted as measures of cytoarchitecture along curvilinear trajectories oriented perpendicular to the cortical layers and surface, and extended
from the outer contour (border of layer I/II) to the inner
contour (layer VI/subcortical white matter border)
(Figs. 2b, c, d, 3b, c, d). Curvilinear trajectories follow the
distortions of the cortical columns, caused by cortical
folding, offering better results than straight trajectories
(Jones et al. 2000; Schleicher et al. 2005; Schmitt and
Bo¨hme 2002). The GLI profiles were standardized to the

cortical thickness of 100 % to normalize variations in
cortical thickness. The shape of these profiles was quantified using a 10-dimensional feature vector which included
the following parameters: mean GLI value, the cortical
depth of the profile’s gravity center, the standard deviation,
the skewness, the kurtosis of the profile, as well as the
analogous parameters for the first derivative of the profile
(Schleicher et al. 1999). The positions of the GLI profiles
along the cortical surface of each ROI were numbered from
1 to n (n indicates the total number of profiles per ROI).
The borders between cytoarchitectonic areas were
identified by significant changes of the feature vectors
between blocks of neighboring GLI profiles (distance between profiles 90 lm). A multivariate distance measure
(Mahalanobis distance, D[2]), that defines the difference
between the neighboring GLI profiles, was used to reveal
these differences (Mahalanobis et al. 1949; Schleicher et al.
2000, 2005), and reflects transitions in laminar patterns
between two cytoarchitectonic areas. The statistical significance of the transitions was tested with Hotellings T[2]

tests and Bonferroni correction (Bartels 1979).

## 1 3


During the identification of areal borders, neighboring
blocks of GLI profiles were moved as sliding windows
along the cortex in steps of one profile position (*90 lm).
A D[2] was calculated for each position. This sliding window
procedure was repeated for block sizes ranging from 8 to
24 profiles. The Mahalanobis distance showed maxima at
locations where the shape of the GLI profiles changed. The
maxima were interpreted as revealing cortical borders
when they were detected and reached significance
throughout most block sizes, and could be reproduced at a
comparable position along the cortical ribbon in several
neighboring sections. In house software based on
MATLAB[�] (MathWorks, USA) was used to define the
areal borders and test their statistical significance (Schleicher et al. 1999). Borders were identified using 4–15 ROIs
per hemisphere. The results of observer-independent detection of cytoarchitectonic borders were microscopically
confirmed.
Despite the significant changes in the shape of GLI
profiles between cortical areas, the profiles within a cortical area show some variability, which leads to a ‘‘noisy’’
course of the Mahalanobis distance curve visible by interposed local maxima (Figs. 2, 3). This ‘‘noisy’’ course
was also found to more or less extent in previous observations of the primary and secondary visual cortex, inferior parietal lobule, intraparietal sulcus, and extrastriate
areas (Amunts et al. 2000; Caspers et al. 2006; Choi et al.
2006; Kujovic et al. 2013; Rottschy et al. 2007). The mean
distance between the local maxima of the Mahalanobis
curve is about 2.5 mm in the present observation. Since
these relatively regular undulations of the Mahalanobis
curve are in sharp contrast to the significant maxima by the
fact that they cannot be observed at comparable positions
over a longer distance in adjacent sections, they probably
indicate patch-like variations of cytoarchitecture within a
cortical area and are not indicative of an interareal border.
The patch-like organization of the microstructure within
cortical areas caused by interdigitating input from different
sources has been repeatedly described in the past in various cortical regions (e.g., Goldman and Nauta 1977;
Goldman-Rakic 1984, 1995; Goldman-Rakic and Schwartz
1982).

Principal component and hierarchical cluster analyses

To further evaluate the parcellation based on the observerindependent approach, a principal component analysis and
a hierarchical cluster analysis (Euclidean distances and
Ward linkage) were performed with feature vectors extracted from the GLI profiles of 11 visual areas separated
by hemispheres. The following areas were included:
hOc4la, hOc4lp (present observation), V1 and V2 (Amunts
et al. 2000), hOc3v and hOc4v (Rottschy et al. 2007),

area measurements (Ai) in the 3D reconstructed histological sections using the following formula:

V ¼ ðs � TÞ � x � y � RAi � F

where s is the distance between two measured sections
(number of sections), T is the thickness of a histological
sections (0.02 mm), x is the width of a pixel (0.0212 mm)
and y is the height of a pixel in the image (0.0212 mm),
RAi is the sum of pixels across all evaluated sections, and
F is the individual shrinkage factor of the brain.
Depending on the extent of each area (hOc4la and
hOc4lp), eight to 14 sections were analyzed per hemisphere
and brain. The volumes of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp were
compared between hemispheres (inter-hemispheric differences) and between male and female brains (gender differences) using an analysis of variance (ANOVA) with a
repeated-measure design.

Continuous probabilistic cytoarchitectonic mapping
in stereotaxic space

The histological volumes of the post-mortem brains were
3D reconstructed (Amunts et al. 2004), and the cytoarchitectonic areas were interactively traced in the corresponding sections of the reconstructed volume. The reconstructed
volumes were spatially normalized to the T1-weighted
single subject reference space of the Montreal Neurological
Institute, the MNI space (Collins et al. 1994; Evans et al.
1993; Holmes et al. 1998) using a combination of affine
and nonlinear, elastic registration transformations (Amunts
et al. 2004; Henn et al. 1997; Ho¨mke 2006). Since the
origin of the MNI space does not coincide with the location
of the anterior commissure (Talairach and Tournoux 1988),
we transformed our data to the anatomical MNI space
(Amunts et al. 2005). The anatomical MNI space differs
from the original MNI space by a linear shift of the origin
in rostro-caudal (shifted 4 mm more caudally) and ventrodorsal (shifted 5 mm more dorsally) directions. The origin
and orientation of the anatomical MNI space accord with
the convention of Talairach and Tournoux (1988).
Following spatial normalization, individual volumes of
areas hOc4la and hOc4lp were registered to the 3D reference space and anatomical continuous probabilistic maps
were generated for both areas (Amunts and Zilles 2001;
Eickhoff et al. 2007; Zilles et al. 2002). These maps reflect
the relative frequency of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp in each
voxel of the 3D reference space (anatomical MNI space).
The degrees of overlap were color coded for both areas.
Centers of gravity of these maps were positioned in the
anatomical MNI space for each hemisphere and brain.
Additionally, maximum probability maps (MPM) of areas
hOc4la and hOc4lp were generated for the meta-analysis of
connectivity and functional properties (see below). These


maps identify the most likely anatomical area in each voxel
of the 3D reference space and provide non-overlapping
maps (Eickhoff et al. 2005).

Connectivity and functional properties of areas hOc4la
and hOc4lp

Functional connectivity of hOC4la and hOc4lp was analyzed by meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM).
The maps of the cytoarchitectonically defined areas served
as seeds. This approach to functional connectivity assesses
which brain regions are co-activated above chance with a
particular seed region in functional neuroimaging experiments. To this end, we employed the BrainMap data[base (Laird et al. 2009, 2011) (www.brainmap.org), which](http://www.brainmap.org)
contained at the time of analysis approximately 10,000
neuroimaging experiments. We only included studies that
reported group analyses of functional mapping experiments
of healthy subjects, yielding approximately 7500 experiments for analysis. To delineate task-based functional
connectivity, i.e., co-activations of hOc4la and hOc4lp, we
first identified all experiments in the BrainMap database
that featured at least one focus of activation in the respective area. Subsequently, the convergence of foci reported in these experiments was quantified using the
revised Activation Likelihood Estimation (ALE) algorithm
(Eickhoff et al. 2009). The key idea behind ALE is to
model the reported foci as 3D Gaussian probability distributions capturing the spatial uncertainty associated with
them. These probabilities are then combined to yield voxelwise ALE scores describing the convergence across experiments. To distinguish ‘true’ convergence between experiments from random convergence (i.e., noise), ALE
scores were compared to a null-distribution reflecting
random spatial association (Eickhoff et al. 2012). The
p value of each experimental ALE value is then given by
the proportion of equal or higher values obtained under the
null distribution and the MACM results were thresholded at
a cluster-level corrected threshold of p \ 0.05 (clusterforming threshold at voxel-level p \ 0.001).
Difference maps comparing task-based functional connectivity maps of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp were

## 1 3


-----

established by first calculating the voxel-wise differences
of the z-scores obtained from the inspected MACM maps.
The experiments contributing to either analysis were then
pooled and randomly divided into two groups of the same
size as the sets of contrasted experiments (Eickhoff et al.
2011). Voxel-wise ALE scores for these two randomly
assembled groups were subtracted from each other and
recorded. Repeating this process 10,000 times yielded an
empirical null distribution of ALE score differences between the two conditions. Based on this permutation-procedure, the map of true differences was then thresholded at
a posterior probability of p [ 0.95 for a true difference
between the two samples. The resulting maps were then
masked with the respective main effect of the minuend
connectivity map to avoid obtaining significant connectivity in voxels of the difference map that do not show
significant co-activation on the underlying connectivity
map (Rottschy et al. 2012).
To identify functional properties and connectivity of
areas hOc4la and hOc4lp, we performed, separately for
each area, meta-analytic connectivity modeling (MACM)
and quantitative functional decoding across a large database of functional neuroimaging studies. The seed regions
of the lateral occipital cortex were defined by the anatomical locations of cytoarchitectonic areas hOc4la and
hOc4lp using their maximum probability map representations in MNI space.
The functional characterization of areas hOc4la and
hOc4lp was based on the BrainMap meta-data that describes the classes of mental processes isolated by the
archived experiments’ statistical contrasts. In this context,
behavioral domains denote the mental processes isolated
by the respective contrast, whereas paradigm classes
[categorize the specific task employed (see http://brainmap.](http://brainmap.org/scribe/)
[org/scribe/ for the complete BrainMap taxonomy). Func-](http://brainmap.org/scribe/)
tional decoding was then based on analyzing the behavioral
domains and paradigm classes’ meta-data associated with
the experiments activating areas hOc4la and hOc4lp, respectively. In particular, we assessed the frequency of
domain ‘‘hits’’ relative to its likelihood across the entire
database (Rottschy et al. 2012). Functional roles for each
area were then identified by significant over-representation
of behavioral domains and paradigm classes in the BrainMap experiments associated with a respective area relative
to the BrainMap database. The base rate is the a priori
probability of any focus to lie in the respective area. The
conditional probability of seed-term associations was then
computed and compared to the base rate using a binominal
test (p \ 0.05), corrected for the false discovery rate within
multiple comparisons. This allowed characterizing the
functional profile of a seed by identifying taxonomic terms,
for which the probability of finding activation in the respective seed was significantly higher as compared to the

term’s baseline (Cieslik et al. 2013; Kellermann et al. 2013;
Reetz et al. 2012).

hOc4la and hOc4lp

We delineated two new cytoarchitectonic areas, hOc4la and
hOc4lp, in the region of the lateral occipital cortex (Fig. 4).
The cytoarchitecture of each area is distinct and differs from
those of neighboring areas. hOc4la (anterior lateral occipital
area) differs from the neighboring occipital areas by higher
cell-packing density in its granular layers (II and IV), less
prominent layer III with larger cells in its sublayer IIIb and
higher cell-packing density in layers V and VI. Layer II is
broad with smaller cells, and its border with sublayer IIIa is
more prominent. The thickness of layer III is slightly reduced, and its segmentation into sublayers is less obvious,
because the pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIb are similar in
size to those in sublayer IIIc. Layer IV is located slightly
higher compared to the neighboring occipital areas, and its
small cells form irregular columns that penetrate into layers
III and V. Layer V is composed of two sublayers (Va and
Vb), and its cell-packing density is lower than that of layer
VI, but the cells of layer V are slightly larger. The border
between layers V and VI is less pronounced, because the cellpacking density of sublayer Vb increases (compared to
sublayer Va) approaching those observed in layer VI
(Figs. 5a, 6a, b, 7a, b).
hOc4lp (posterior lateral occipital area) is characterized
by a prominent layer III, with a clear radial arrangement
and larger pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc and lower cellpacking density in layer V. Granular layers II and IV have
a lower cell-packing density than anterior area hOc4la, and
the border between layers II and III is less clear. Layer III
is broad, with densely packed cells arranged in radial
columns. It is composed of three sublayers (IIIa, IIIb and
IIIc), and pyramidal cells in these sublayers increase
gradually in their size from sublayer IIIa to IIIc. Pyramidal
cells in sublayers IIIb and IIIc are smaller than those in area
hOc4la. Layer IV is located slightly lower than in hOc4la,
and layers V and VI are narrower and less densely packed
in area hOc4lp than in area hOc4la. Neurons in sublayer Va
are smaller than those of area hOc4la, and sublayer Vb of
area hOc4lp is less densely packed, which makes the border between layers V and VI more pronounced (Figs. 5b,
8a–c, 9a, b).
hOc4la shares common borders with occipital extrastriate areas hOc4lp (Fig. 6a), hOc5 and hOc4v (Fig. 6b).

hOc4la. In DA, layer III is less prominent with a cellpacking density more similar across sublayers and with
smaller pyramidal cells than in hOc4la. Layer V is more
densely packed compared to hOc4la, and its cells are
smaller than those in layer VI (Fig. 7a).
In the region of the temporo-occipital junction and
ventral to the anterior part of hOc4la, area FG2 is visible
(Caspers et al. 2013), which extends further into the inferior temporal cortex. Compared to hOc4la, area FG2 has a
higher cell-packing density in layers II, IIIa and IV, smaller
pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc and more densely packed
layers V and VI. Sublayer IIIb of FG2 is lower in cellpacking density and layer VI can be separated in two
sublayers: VIa and VIb (Fig. 7b).
hOc4lp shares common borders with occipital extrastriate areas hOc3d, hOc4d, hOc3v, hOc4v and hOc4la

along the dorsal part of LOC. The cytoarchitecture of
hOc4lp differs from that of area hOc3d by a less pronounced radial cellular arrangement, less uniform cellpacking density through the whole cortical thickness, larger
pyramidal cells in sublayers IIIb, IIIc and Va, and more
densely packed layers V and VI (Fig. 8a). The border between hOc4lp and hOc4d is characterized by a lower cellpacking density in layers II and IIIa and smaller pyramidal
cells in sublayers IIIb and IIIc in area hOc4lp. Layer IV of
hOc4lp is located slightly higher, and the thickness of layer
III is slightly reduced compared to hOc4d. The thickness of
layers V and VI is greater in hOc4lp and pyramidal cells in
layer V are smaller than those in hOc4d. Layer VI is more
densely packed in hOc4d than in hOc4lp, and the border
between layer VI and subcortical white matter is more
pronounced (Fig. 8b).
hOc4lp borders areas hOc3v and hOc4v along the ventral part of LOC (Fig. 9a, b). Compared to hOc3v, area
hOc4lp has lower cell-packing density in layers II, IIIa and
IV, a more densely packed layer V and larger pyramidal
cells in sublayers IIIa and IIIb. The thickness of layers V
and VI is greater in hOc4lp, while the thickness of layer III
is reduced compared to area hOc3v (Fig. 9a). The border

pyramidal cells in sublayers IIIb, IIIc and Va in area
hOc4lp. The thickness of layer III in both areas is approximately equal (Fig. 9b).
A here not further delineated area DA (Fig. 8c) with
higher cell-packing density in layers II, IV and V and
smaller pyramidal neurons in sublayers IIIb and IIIc is also
found dorsal to hOc4lp. Layer III of that area is more
uniform in cell-packing density and size of cells across its
sublayers. The average size of its pyramidal cells in deeper
layer III and Va is approximately equal.

Location with respect to the gross anatomical
landmarks

hOc4la is located in rostral and ventral portions of LOC
behind the anterior occipital sulcus. hOC4la occupies the
anterior thirds of the middle and inferior lateral occipital
gyrus divided by the inferior lateral occipital sulcus. The
most ventral part of hOc4la extends behind and above to

incisure, extending just above to the inferolateral margin of
the occipital lobe.
hOc4lp occupies the caudal and dorsal portions of the

and middle lateral occipital gyri, divided by the inconstant

most of cases (15 out of 20 hemispheres), the dorsal part of
area hOc4lp is located behind the transverse occipital sulcus. (Figs. 1b, 4a, b).

Location with respect to adjacent cytoarchitectonic
areas

hOc4la is located immediately behind the area hOc5
(Malikovic et al. 2007). hOc4la hooks around the caudal
half of the area hOc5 (Fig. 10). hOc4la shares common
borders with two extrastriate areas at its caudal border:
hOc4lp and hOc4v (Rottschy et al. 2007). Finally, hOc4la
shares a common border with the area FG2 (Caspers et al.
2013) in the region of the temporo-occipital incisure along
the inferolateral margin of the occipital lobe. FG2 is located ventral and rostral of hOc4la in the region of the
posterior fusiform gyrus extending along its lateral portion.
hOc4lp is located immediately behind the area hOc4la.
Areas hOc4d and hOc3d (Kujovic et al. 2013) are located
dorsal and caudal to the area hOc4lp, respectively. Ventral
to the area hOc4lp, there are three extrastriate areas, V2
(Amunts et al. 2000, hOc3v and hOc4v (Rottschy et al.
2007) (Fig. 10).
Figure 10 depicts the extent in ten brains of the areas
hOc4la and hOc4lp and of all other visual areas which have

## 1 3


been cytoarchitectonically identified using the same
method. Although the topographical relation between the
areas is consistent in all brains, a considerable inter-subject
variability in extent and position of the areas can be seen.
This will be further analyzed by calculating continuous
probability maps (see below).

Cluster analyses of cytoarchitectonic areas

The cytoarchitecture quantified by GLI profiles is studied
across hemispheres using hierarchical cluster and principal
component analyses. This allows the validation of the delineation of cytoarchitectonic areas and to further expand on
the question of cytoarchitectonic clusters between and
within regions. The analyses separately for the right and left
hemispheres and areas V1, V2, hOc3d, hOc3v, hOc4d,
hOc4v, hOc4la, hOc4lp, hOc5, FG1 and FG2 demonstrates:

- These visual areas form four clusters with the primary
(V1) and secondary (V2) visual cortex in one cluster, areas
hOc3d, hOc4d and hOc5 in another cluster, areas hOc3v
and hOc4v in a third cluster, and areas hOc4la, hOc4lp,
FG1 and FG2 in a fourth cluster (Fig. 11a). It shows that
the very early visual areas V1 and V2 clearly differ from
the other three clusters. Furthermore, the dorsal stream
areas in cluster 2 greatly differ from the other clusters,
whereas the areas in clusters 3 and 4 are relatively close to
each other in the principal component analysis.

- The hierarchical cluster analysis (Fig. 11b) supports the
result of the principal component analysis. In most cases,
the same cytoarchitectonic area on the left and right
hemisphere is closer aligned than different areas in the
same hemisphere. There are some exceptions, e.g.,
hOc3v and hOc4v in each hemisphere seem to be more
similar to each of these areas across hemispheres. Left
hOc4la seems to be more similar to FG2 than to right
hOc4la. Finally, right V2 seems to be more similar to left
and right V1 than to left V2. These seemingly exceptions
must be interpreted, however, with some caution,
because the Silhouette analysis predicts an optimal
number of four clusters, which means, that the examined
areas cannot be separated at the level of hemispheres.
This is probably so because the GLI profiles do not
provide a signal to noise ratio strong enough to reach
significant levels of similarity or dissimilarity. Therefore,
both analyses demonstrate that the observer-independent
approach enables a quantitatively based parcellation
which clearly separates different cytoarchitectonic areas
and enables a hierarchical positioning of the areas.

- A comparison of profiles extracted from several sectors
within both hOc4la and hOc4lp does not support a
significant dissimilarity in cytoarchitecture of such
sectors within each of these areas.

Volumes of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp

The mean volume of area hOc4la, measured in all 20
hemispheres is 2.61 cm[3] (SD 0.89). The mean right volume
(measured in 10 right hemispheres) of hOc4la is slightly,
but not significantly (p [ 0.05) larger (2.81 cm[3], SD 0.97)
than that of the left side (2.42 cm[3], SD 0.79). Eight out of
ten brains show a larger mean volume of area hOc4la in the
right than in the left hemisphere. The individual volumes of
area hOc4la vary between 1.45 and 4.28 cm[3] in the right
hemisphere (factor of 2.9), and between 1.37 and 4.01 cm[3]

in the left (factor of 2.9).
The mean volume of hOc4lp (measured in all 20 hemispheres) is 2.39 cm[3] (SD = 0.59), and is slightly smaller


(0.22 cm[3]) compared to that of area hOc4la. The mean left
volume (measured in 10 left hemispheres) of hOc4lp is
significantly (p \ 0.05) larger (2.64 cm[3], SD 0.81) than that
of the right side (2.13 cm[3], SD = 0.37). Nine out of ten
brains have larger mean volumes of area hOc4lp in the left
than in the right hemisphere. The individual volumes of area
hOc4lp vary between 1.74 and 4.09 cm[3] in the left (factor of
2.3), and between 1.72 and 2.59 cm[3] in the right hemisphere
(factor of 1.5). The mean volume of both lateral occipital
areas, hOc4la plus hOc4lp, is larger in male than in female
brains, but this difference is not significant (p [ 0.05). The
absolute volumes and the relative volumes (normalized by
brain weight) of hOc4la and hOc4lp did not show any
consistent change with age in our sample.

hOc4la and hOc4lp (Fig. 12). These maps show the interindividual variability color coded in a spectral sequence
from dark blue (lowest areal presentation) to dark red

## 1 3


(highest areal presentation). Regions of highest overlap of
all 10 examined brains are found for both areas, as well as a
considerable inter-individual variability in their extent.
The centers of gravity of area hOc4la based on probability maps are -46, -84, 3 (left hemisphere) and 47,
-81, 4 (right hemisphere). The centers of gravity of area
hOc4lp are -35, -95, 10 (left hemisphere) and 36, -93, 8
(right hemisphere). Both areas are located slightly more
rostrally in the right than in the left hemisphere (Table 2).

Functional properties of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp

When searching the BrainMap database for experiments
activating area hOc4la, we found a total of 655 experiments (involving a total of 8760 subjects) that featured
at least one focus of activation in the MPM representation
of this area. 593 experiments (involving a total of 7903
subjects) were found to activate area hOc4lp.
Quantitative functional decoding based on the BrainMap
meta-data reveals that both areas are involved in visual
perception, in particular the processing of shapes. They are
additionally activated during action observation, spatial
processing, and the processing of orthography (in particular
hOc4lp).
Paradigm-specific analysis showed that hOc4la and
hOc4lp are activated during passive viewing, spatial location discrimination, mental rotation and subjective emotional picture discrimination. Both areas are also associated
with visual attention and visual tracking. Notably, hOc4la
is more strongly associated with more ‘‘receptive’’ functions, i.e., passive viewing paradigms such as film viewing,
while hOc4lp is more strongly associated with cognitive
tasks including counting and the Wisconsin card sorting
test as well as language-related tasks, in particular word
generation.

Functional connectivity of areas hOc4la and hOc4lp

The conjunction analysis demonstrated that overlapping
co-activations of hOc4la and hOc4lp occur in visual perception of objects and faces, object recognition and object
manipulation. In both hemispheres, hOc4la and hOc4lp are
co-activated bilaterally with the posterior fusiform cortex
(area FG2, Caspers et al. 2013), posterior parietal cortex,
medial premotor cortex (SMA) and primary motor cortex
(Fig. 13a–c).
Differences in functional connectivity of hOc4la and
hOc4lp were assessed by computing the contrast between
the two MACM maps. This analysis reveals differential coactivation likelihoods in particular for the posterior parietal
cortex. In both hemispheres, hOc4la was significantly
stronger connected with the superficially exposed posterior
superior parietal cortex (cytoarchitectonic areas 7A and 7P;

Co-activation of hOc4la and hOc4lp occurs in areas
frequently associated with language processing. hOc4la is

inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal and angular gyri)
and Broca’s region of both hemispheres, whereas hOc4lp
of both hemispheres is co-activated with the inferior parietal cortex (supramarginal and angular gyri), Broca’s

Discussion

Correlations with previous cytoarchitectonic maps

Area hOc4la shares a common border with the previously
identified area hOc5 (Malikovic et al. 2007). The cytoarchitecture of hOc4la corresponds to that of a previously
mentioned (Malikovic et al. 2007), but not delineated area
located ventrally to hOc5. Here, we could define the whole
extent of that area and identified it as area hOc4la. It surrounds caudal and ventral parts of area hOc5 in most cases.
Our cytoarchitectonic description of hOc4la matches in
many aspects that of the area 37ac defined by Sarkisov
et al. (1949). Area 37ac has a higher cell-packing density of
granular layers II and IV compared to neighboring occipital
areas, and layer IV borders layers III and V ‘‘in a zigzag
way’’, which agrees well with our finding of irregular
cellular columns in layer IV, that penetrate into adjacent
layers III and V. Furthermore, areas 37ac and hOc4la have
a lower cell-packing density of layer V compared to layer
VI and larger cells in layer V than in layer VI. hOc4la is
found at a comparable location as area 37ac, i.e., in the
most anterior part of the lateral occipital cortex reaching
the temporo-occipital junction. However, hOc4la has a
smaller dorsal extent compared to area 37ac, which occupies the most anterior parts of all three lateral occipital gyri
where it extends from the inferolateral margin of the occipital lobe to the angular gyrus of the inferior parietal
lobule. hOc4la is restricted to the middle and inferior lateral occipital gyri.
Ventral to the anterior part of hOc4la, we found an area
that extended further into the inferior temporal cortex
(Fig. 7b). The cytoarchitectonic features of this area correspond in part to area 37a defined by Sarkisov et al.
(1949). It is characterized by a wide layer II, brighter
sublayer IIIb (indicating either lower cell-packing density

## 1 3


or smaller cells), and darker sublayer IIIc (due to the
presence of larger pyramidal cells). This area is located
along the lateral half of the posterior fusiform gyrus and
has recently been identified by Caspers et al. (2013) as area
FG2. hOc4la has a lower cell-packing density compared to
area FG2, particularly in layers II and IV.
The cytoarchitecture of hOc4lp fits to the description of
area 19 (area praeoccipitalis) by Sarkisov et al. (1949).
They found ‘‘the dominance’’ of layers II, III and IV
compared to layers V and VI, which are reduced in their
thickness, a less obvious transition between layers II and
III, a well established layer III with clear transitions between its sublayers, larger pyramidal cells in sublayer IIIc,
‘‘brighter layer V’’ (lower in cell-packing density) with
smaller cells compared to ‘‘darker layer VI’’ (higher in cellpacking density). All these features are found in hOc4lp.
Unfortunately, Sarkisov et al. (1949) did not map regional
cytoarchitectonic variations within area 19, with the exception of its dorsal part, subarea praeoccipitalis superior,
which partly correlates to hOc4d (Kujovic et al. 2,013).
The architectonic characterization of the border between
hOc4la and hOc4lp matches with that between areas 37ac
and 19.
Area hOc4lp shares common borders with the previously identified dorsal extrastriate areas hOc3d and hOc4d
(Kujovic et al. 2013). The border between areas hOc4lp
and hOc4d is smaller compared to that between areas
hOc4lp and hOc3d. The cytoarchitectonic criteria for the
delineation between hOc4lp and hOc4d match our previous
findings (Kujovic et al. 2013), where we described the
lateral border of hOc4d. Similarly, there is an agreement
between the criteria for the delineation of hOc4lp from the
previously defined area hOc3d. The sizes of pyramidal
cells in sublayers IIIb, IIIc and Va, as well as the cellpacking density in layers V and VI, are the most reliable
criteria to differentiate hOc4lp from neighboring hOc3d
(Fig. 8a).
Two extrastriate areas, hOc3v and hOc4v (Rottschy
et al. 2007) are identified ventral to area hOc4lp. These
areas are mainly located along the ventral surface of the
occipital lobe, and occupy parts of the lateral occipital
surface closer to the occipital pole. When we compare

The principal component analysis demonstrates that the
observer-independent approach enables a quantitatively
based parcellation which clearly separates different cytoarchitectonic areas. Notably, the very early visual areas
V1 and V2 and the ventral stream areas hOc3v and hOc4v
form two separate clusters which are located far from each
other and from the other two clusters comprising the dorsal
stream areas hOc3d and hOc4d as well as hOc5, and the
fusiform areas FG1 and FG2 as well as areas hOc4la and

hOc4lp, respectively. The hierarchical cluster analysis
supports these findings and highlights the position of
hOc4la and hOc4lp at a high hierarchical level.
The sizes of hOc4la and hOc4lp did not show significant
gender differences, or correlations with age. The lack of
differences may be a result of the relatively small sample
size for questions of this type.

Correlations to the existing human functional imaging
maps

The cytoarchitectonically defined areas hOc4la and hOc4lp
may correspond by their location, topographical relation to
other visual areas, and coordinate-based meta-analysis to
the functionally defined areas LO-2 and LO-1, respectively
(Larsson and Heeger 2006). Therefore, they would be part
of the object-selective lateral occipital complex.
A comparison of the sizes of LO-1 and LO-2 and hOc4la
and hOc4lp with the primary visual cortex also supports the
notion of a possible comparability. The surface areas of
LO-1 and LO-2 are similar in size (about 331 mm[2]; LO-1
321(left) and 340 (right) mm[2] and LO-2 289 (left) and 374
(right) mm[2]; Larsson and Heeger 2006). Notably, the same
relation was found for our volumetric data of hOc4la
(2.42 cm[3] in the left and 2.81 cm[3] in the right hemisphere)
and hOc4lp (2.64 cm[3] in the left and 2.13 cm[3] in the right
hemisphere). Moreover, the mean surface areas of LO-1
and LO-2 occupy approximately 30 % of the mean surface
area of V1 (Larsson and Heeger 2006), and the mean
volumes of hOc4la and hOc4lp also amount to approximately 30 % (hOc4la is 34 % and hOc4lp is 31 %) of
the mean volume of hOc1 (BA17 or V1; Amunts et al.
2007). Therefore, we think that this comparison between
the functionally defined LO-1 and LO-2 (Larsson and
Heeger 2006) and the cytoarchitectonically defined areas
hOc4la and hOc4lp of the present observations support a
good comparability.
LO-2 of Larsson and Heeger (2006) has a close topographical relationship with functionally defined areas V5/
MT? located anteriorly, and hV4 located inferiorly. This is
in accordance with the present cytoarchitectonic findings,
where hOc4la has comparable relationships with areas
hOc5 and hOc4v (Malikovic et al. 2007; Rottschy et al.
2007). This is also found in various functional maps (e.g.,
Abdollahi et al. 2014). Area LO-1 is located anterior to the
functionally defined area V3 and ventral to V3A. Similarly,
hOc4lp shares common borders with two cytoarchitectonic
areas, namely hOc3d and hOc4d (Kujovic et al. 2013),
along its posterior and dorsal parts, respectively. hOc3d
occupies posterior locations to hOc4d. Ventrally, LO-1
abuts cytoarchitectonic areas hOc3v and hOc4v, which
overlap with functional areas V3 and hV4, VO1 or phPITv,
respectively (Abdollahi et al. 2014).

Functional properties and connectivity of areas hOc4la
and hOc4lp

Areas hOc4la and hOc4lp are associated with visual perception, and in particular with processing of object shape,
but not with visual motion perception as shown in the
present observations by quantitative functional decoding
based on the BrainMap database. This is in agreement with
results of Larsson and Heeger (2006), who demonstrated
that areas LO-1 and LO-2 strongly responded to images of
objects but were not motion selective. This object-related
activity and co-activation with the posterior fusiform cortex (also an object-selective region) provide converging
evidence that areas hOc4la and hOc4lp can be considered
as a portion of the functionally defined LOC (Grill-Spector
2003). Furthermore, the object-related activity is important
for the detection of similar shapes such as letters, and may
explain involvement of hOc4la and hOc4lp in orthography
and understanding of written words. Additionally, the
connectivity with the posterior fusiform cortex (visual
word form area FG2 of Caspers et al. 2013), middle temporal and inferior parietal cortex as well as Broca’s region
and the anterior insula supports involvement of these extrastriate areas in language-related processing and reading.
In this context, we observed a functional segregation
among areas hOc4la and hOc4lp. The contrast analysis
demonstrates stronger co-activations of hOc4la with the
bilateral middle temporal cortex, whereas hOC4lp shows
stronger bilateral co-activation with the inferior parietal
cortex and Broca’s region.
Somewhat unexpected is the finding that hOc4la and
hOc4lp are also significantly associated with tasks involving spatial location discrimination, mental rotation,
visual attention and visual tracking. Moreover, co-activations of hOc4la and hOc4lp with the posterior parietal
cortex (superior parietal and intraparietal cortex) and the
premotor cortex are found here. These functional interactions suggest that both lateral occipital areas are also potentially involved in a functional network related to spatialand action-related processing. Furthermore, supplementary
contrast analyses showed that hOc4la is more closely
connected with the superior parietal cortex compared to
hOc4lp, which shows significantly stronger functional
connectivity with the intraparietal cortex (Fig. 13d). These
findings further support the above mentioned functional
segregation among the two cytoarchitectonic areas.
Our functional and connectivity data of hOc4la and
hOc4lp suggest that these extrastriate areas may interact
with both the dorsal and ventral visual processing streams,
rather than exclusively participate in one of these two
streams (see Larsson and Heeger 2006). Our findings further suggest that the cytoarchitectonically (hOc4la and
hOc4lp) and functionally (LO-2 and LO-1) defined areas in


-----

the region of the lateral occipital cortex may be considered
comparable. Finally, these two extrastriate areas seem to
represent the anatomical equivalent to the lateral occipital
complex (LO; divided into LO-1 and LO-2, Weiner and
Grill-Spector 2011), an area involved in the visual object
recognition originally described by Malach et al. (1995),
which is located immediately behind area V5/MT?.
