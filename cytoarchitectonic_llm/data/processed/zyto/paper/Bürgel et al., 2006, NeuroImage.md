The position and extent of individual fiber tracts within the white
matter of human brains can be identified in vivo using diffusion
tensor imaging (DTI) and fiber tracking methods. Previous to this
study, however, the lack of three-dimensional (3-D) probability maps
precluded comparing the anatomical precision of MRI studies with
microscopically defined fiber tracts in human postmortem brains. The
present study provides 3-D registered maps of the topography, course
and intersubject variability of major fiber tracts, which were
identified at microscopic resolution. The analyzed tracts include the
corticospinal tract, optic and acoustic radiations, fornix, cingulum,
corpus callosum, superior longitudinal, superior and inferior occipitofrontal and uncinate fascicles; sources and targets of fiber tracts
include the lateral and medial geniculate nuclei and mamillary bodies.
Tracts and nuclei were identified in serial myelin-stained histological
sections of ten postmortem brains. The sections were 3-D reconstructed and registered to a standardized stereotaxic space of an in
vivo MR reference brain by means of linear and non-linear, elastic
transformations. The individual fiber tracts and nuclei were superimposed in the reference space, and probability maps were generated
as a quantitative measure of intersubject variability for each voxel of
the stereotaxic space. This study presents the first stereotaxic atlas of
the course, location and extent of fiber tracts and related nuclei based
on microscopically defined localization and topographic data taken at
multiple levels on each of the three orthogonal planes. The maps are
useful for evaluating and identifying fiber bundles in DTI, for
localizing subcortical lesions visible in anatomical MR images and
for studying neuronal connectivity.

Introduction

The rapid development of MR imaging techniques and, in
particular, diffusion tensor MRI (DT-MRI) has renewed interest in
precise fiber tract anatomy. Previously, microstructural information
on the course of major fiber tracts was obtained in immature brains
by distinguishing early myelinating fiber tracts from the still nonstained, later myelinating ones (Flechsig, 1920; Yakovlev and
Lecours, 1967). Such studies have contributed important information on the topography of fiber tracts and their maturation during
ontogeny. They do not, however, provide stereotaxic topographic
information about the course and extent of fiber tracts in the (adult)
human brain nor do they address intersubject variability and
interhemispheric asymmetry, both of which are important aspects
of brain anatomy (Zilles et al., 1996, 1997). Tracing studies, which
are frequently performed in experimental animals, are either
impossible or have restricted application in the human brain.
Tracing studies in adult human brains have used, for example,
degenerated axons in pathologically altered brains (e.g., Clarke and
Miklossy, 1990; Mufson et al., 1990; Miklossy and van der Loos,
1991; Clarke, 1994; Di Virgilio and Clarke, 1997; Wiesendanger et
al., 2004) or polarized light microscopy (Axer and Keyserlingk,
2000).
The development of DTI has opened new opportunities for
analyzing white matter in the living human brain (e.g., Le Bihan
et al., 1986; Turner et al., 1990; Basser and Pierpaoli, 1994;
Piearpoli et al., 1996; Iwasawa et al., 1997; Makris et al., 1997;
Clark et al., 1999; Conturo et al., 1999; Virta et al., 1999; Werring
et al., 1999; Basser et al., 2000; Barker, 2001; Coenen et al.,
2001; Krings et al., 2001; Stieltjes et al., 2001; Mori and van Zijl,
2002; Hagemann et al., 2003; Bu¨chel et al., 2004; Schoth and
Krings, 2005; Wakana et al., 2004, 2005). The method is based on
the fact that measured diffusivity depends on the orientation of the
principal axes of fiber tracts (for a review, see, e.g., Basser and

Jones, 2002). Fiber tract trajectories are generated from a fluid
velocity field. Several fiber tracts of the white matter, the brain
stem, the spinal cord as well as single nerves (e.g., optic nerve)
have been traced this way, and these studies represent tremendous
progress for analyzing connectivity in the adult human brain
(Ramnani et al., 2004). Connectivity maps in the macaque brain,
obtained using DTI and fast marching tractography (FMT), are
consistent with known anatomy (Parker et al., 2002). DT-MRI has
been applied successfully to neurological and psychiatric studies
to demonstrate and analyze alterations of the white matter in
different diseases, such as multiple sclerosis and schizophrenia
(Iwasawa et al., 1997; Barker, 2001; Foong et al., 2002; Ardekani
et al., 2003, Kubicki et al., 2005). There are, however, limitations
of the method (Koch et al., 2002) if discrete, coarsely sampled,
noisy, voxel-averaged direction field data are used on incoherently
organized nerve pathways (Basser and Jones, 2002) or if fibers
merge, branch or cross each other (Le Bihan et al., 2001). DTMRIs are not capable, in a strict sense, of investigating anatomical
connectivity.
Using a modified myelin staining technique, fiber tracts have
been mapped in histological sections of ten adult human brains at
microscopic resolution, and probabilistic, three-dimensional maps
of the optic radiation (Bu¨rgel et al., 1999), the corticospinal tract
(Rademacher et al., 2001) and the auditory system (Rademacher et
al., 2002) have been published. The aim of the present study was to
extend and supplement these studies by mapping ten fiber tracts;
corticospinal tract, optic radiation, acoustic radiation, fornix,
cingulum, corpus callosum, superior longitudinal fascicle, superior
and inferior occipito-frontal fascicles, uncinate fascicle and three
associated nuclei; lateral and medial geniculate bodies; and
mamillary body. Individual maps were registered to the T1weighted single subject brain of the Montreal Neurological
Institute (FMNI reference brain_; Evans et al., 1993; Collins et
al., 1994; Holmes et al., 1998), generating probabilistic maps. The
spatial topography of the structures, their relationships with each
other, with surrounding macroscopic landmarks and subcortical
nuclei, and their intersubject variability were analyzed via the
probabilistic maps.

Materials and methods

Ten human brains (Table 1) without any history of neuropathological or psychiatric diseases in their clinical records or
neuropathological alterations in the histological sections were
analyzed. Brains were obtained from the body donor program of
the Anatomical Institute of the University of Duesseldorf. Handedness of body donors was unknown. High-resolution MR imaging
of the brains was performed after fixation and prior to histological
embedding and further processing (Roland and Zilles, 1994; Zilles
et al., 1995; Amunts et al., 2000; Geyer et al., 1996) with a
Siemens 1.5 T scanner (Erlangen, Germany) and a T1-weighted
FLASH sequence (flip angle = 40-; repetition time (TR) = 40 ms;
echo time (TE) = 5 ms for each image). The complete brains were
fixed in formalin or Bodian solution (a mixture of formalin, glacial
acetic acid and ethanol), embedded in paraffin and serially
sectioned in the coronal plane at 20 Am. Depending on the size
of the brain, a series of 4000 to 7500 sections per brain was
obtained. Each 60th section of the complete series (distance
between sections: 1.2 mm) was stained with a modified Heidenhain–Woelcke technique for myelin (Bu¨rgel et al., 1997; Figs.

1+2). Neighboring sections were stained for cell bodies (Merker,
1983).
Traditional myelin stains can rarely distinguish individual tracts
within the densely packed fibers of the adult human white matter.
The modification of the Heidenhain–Woelcke stain increases
lithium ions, which destain the tissue by inactivating the
chromatogen complexes in the thinnest myelin sheaths, thus
decreasing the overall background staining and producing a graded
reduction in myelin staining on fiber tracts. The reduction appears
proportional to the degree of myelination of the tracts. The result
enhances the contrast between fiber tracts, enabling us to
distinguish different pathways according to their degrees of
myelination. In summary, the protocol differentially stains myelinated connections in the adult human brain in a manner resembling
the differential staining of fiber tracts during myelination of early
postnatal brains.
The myelin-stained sections were digitized via a CCD camera
(8 bit gray resolution; depth of field and tissue thickness of 20 Am;
final resolution of 0.9 � 0.9 � 1.2 mm per voxel), and 3-D
reconstruction followed (Schormann and Zilles, 1998). Deformation of the images of the histological sections that inevitably arise
during histological processing (from vagaries of dehydration,
embedding, cutting and mounting on glass slides) is corrected
using both the MR images of the complete brain prior to
embedding and the digitized histological sections. The 3-D
reconstructed histological volumes of the ten brains were warped
to the single-subject MNI reference brain (Evans et al., 1993;
Collins et al., 1994; Holmes et al., 1998; Mohlberg et al., 2003). To
align the data with the ‘‘anatomical MNI space,’’ they were shifted
by 4 mm and 5 mm in the coronal and axial planes, respectively
(Amunts and Zilles, in press). The shift placed the brain data sets
along the line connecting the anterior and posterior commissures in
the midsagittal plane (the AC–PC line), where the orientation and
origin correspond to the system proposed by Talairach and
Tournoux (1988). Warping was performed using histogram
correction, linear, affine and non-linear, elastic transformations
(Schormann and Zilles, 1998; Amunts et al., 2004). The elastic
image registration is based on the Navier–Lame´ equations, which
are solved using a multigrid method for the inner iteration with a
multiscale approach (Henn et al., 1997; Ho¨mke, 2005).

The following fiber tracts and subcortical nuclei were microscopically identified (Table 2).

### & The corticospinal tract originating from Brodmann’s area 4
(Brodmann, 1909), including subareas 4a and 4p (Geyer et al.,
1996),
### & The optic radiation and the lateral geniculate body (Bu¨rgel et
al., 1999),
### & The acoustic radiation and the medial geniculate body, & The fornix and the mamillary body, & The corpus callosum and & Long-association fiber tracts including the superior longitudinal
fascicle, the superior and inferior occipito-frontal fascicles and
the uncinate fascicle.

Fiber tracts and nuclei were identified in both hemispheres of
each brain (Figs. 1 and 2) using the descriptions of Kretschmann
and Weinrich (1996) and Nieuwenhuys et al. (1988). Both the
heavily stained projection fiber tracts and the less intensely stained
long-association tracts are differentiated from the background and
can, therefore, be precisely identified. This technique also enabled
us to map critical regions where fibers cross each other, become
microscopically thin, merge or when fibers are densely packed as
in the temporal isthmus. Additionally, we used origin and/or target
structures, such as the lateral geniculate body and the striate area,
to define tracts, like the optic radiation.
Mapping was performed in coronal sections. This cutting plane
favors the delineation of those fiber tracts which run in mediolateral and dorso-ventral directions. It makes it more difficult to
follow fibers that go rostro-caudally and which do not appear in the
coronal sections as elongated fiber bundles. From this, we may
assume that long-association fiber tracts connecting the occipital
and frontal lobes are probably underestimated, whereas the
corticospinal tract has been defined more completely. We do not,
however, expect to overestimate the extent of fiber tracts.
By analyzing the histological texture of the white matter at high
magnification (up to 400�), we were able to use differences in the
contours of sectioned fibers (fibers running vertically to the plane
of sectioning appear as ring-shaped structures at higher magnification, whereas obliquely or parallel running fibers appear as
shorter or longer dark lines), in tract orientation (circular contours
are observed in vertical tracts, whereas elongated contours are
those oblique to the plane of sectioning) and in staining intensity to
delineate distinct pathways within a single section and through a
series of sections. Thus, we could follow myelinated fibers
throughout their entire course. The start and target structures of
the acoustic radiation (medial geniculate body and Heschl’s gyrus)

Table 2
Characterization of fiber tracts


were identified using immediately adjacent sections, which were
stained for cell bodies. The well-known start and/or endpoints of
the corticospinal tract, the optic and the acoustic radiations were
used to begin the relevant delineations.
The corpus callosum was mapped starting from the brain
midline and following the fibers laterally until they could no longer
be distinguished at high magnification (up to 400�). The
identification of the long-association tracts, such as the superior
longitudinal fascicle, began in the middle compact part of the tract
(Fig. 2). Fibers were followed towards the periphery in the
anterior–posterior direction for as long as they could be differentiated from the background tissue.
In a next step, the fibers were interactively marked in each
digitized histological image using an image analyzer (KS400[*]

V2.0, Kontron, Germany), and 3-D reconstructed (Figs. 1c, 2b).
The labeling procedure was validated by two independent
observers: the intra- and inter-rater variability did not exceed T1
mm for each direction (Bu¨rgel et al., 1999). The topographical
relationships between the fiber tracts and nuclei as well as the
surrounding anatomical landmarks and basal ganglia were
observed by simultaneously displaying all structures of the
reconstructed data set in a single brain (Figs. 4–6). Visualization
was performed in all three orthogonal planes.
The delineated fiber tracts and nuclei were then registered to the
anatomic MNI space. ‘‘Probability’’ or ‘‘population’’ maps quantified the relative frequency with which a certain fiber tract or
nucleus of the ten brains was present in each voxel of the reference
brain. For example, a 50% value of a fiber tract in a certain voxel
of the reference brain indicates that the fiber tract was present in
that voxel in five out of ten brains. The percentage of overlap was
color-coded in steps of 10% (Figs. 7–16). The probabilistic maps
serve as a measure of intersubject variability for each voxel of the
reference space.

Results

Positions and topographical relationships of fiber tracts and nuclei

We mapped that part of the corticospinal tract, which
originates from Brodmann’s area 4 (Brodmann, 1909), i.e., from
areas 4a and 4p (Geyer et al., 1996). The tract runs through the
posterior limb of the internal capsule (Dejerine, 1901; Penfield
and Boldrey, 1937; Fries et al., 1993) and reaches the brain stem
(Figs. 4a–d, 5a–f, 6a–f).
Two long-association pathways are in close topographical
relationship to the corticospinal tract; the superior longitudinal

fascicle and superior occipito-frontal fascicle. The lower part of the
superior longitudinal fascicle runs lateral to the corticospinal tract,
dorsolateral to the putamen and medial to the upper insula (Figs.
4b–d). Lateral to the entrance of the internal capsule, it turns
medial and crosses the motor fibers (Figs. 4b+c, 5a+b, 6c–e). It is
thought (Dejerine, 1901) that it connects parts of the frontal lobe
(Broca’s area) with the occipital (visual areas), parietal and
temporal lobes (Wernicke’s area). Where the tracing became
ambiguous (in the most rostral and most caudal sections), we
stopped tracking the fibers.
The superior occipito-frontal fascicle forms the medial border
of the corticospinal tract and separates it from the lateral
ventricles (Figs. 4c, 5b). The fibers run in parallel to the
dorsolateral margin of the lateral ventricles below the corpus
callosum. It is assumed that the prefrontal cortex projects via the
superior occipito-frontal fascicle to limbic and paralimbic
association cortices (Nieuwenhuys et al., 1988).
Fibers of the optic radiation take their origin in the lateral
geniculate body. This nucleus is part of the metathalamus and has a
characteristic laminar pattern. It is located latero-ventrally to the
pulvinar (Figs. 4c, 5e, 6c+d). The efferent optic fibers leave the
nucleus in a rostro-lateral direction (Figs. 4c, 5e) and form the socalled knee of the optic radiation. More distally, the fibers run in a
rostro-dorsal direction around the temporal horn of the lateral
ventricle. The optic radiation is ventral to the acoustic radiation
(Figs. 4c, 6b) and turns toward the occipital pole in an almost
sagittal plane, running laterally to the occipital horn of the lateral
ventricle (Figs. 4d–e, 5c–e). The optic fibers surround the
occipital horn of the lateral ventricle and the major forceps of
the corpus callosum (Figs. 4f, 5c, 6d+e) to cross towards the mesial
surface of the brain. They reach their major target at the superior
and inferior banks of the calcarine sulcus; Brodmann’s area 17
(Amunts et al., 2000) (Figs. 4f, 5c–f, 6a).
The medial geniculate body, another part of the metathalamus,
is medial and slightly ventral to the lateral geniculate body. The
acoustic radiation leaves the medial geniculate body in a rostrolateral direction (Figs. 4c, 5e, 6b). It then runs rostro-dorsally to the
optic radiation, crosses the temporal isthmus and ascends towards
the primary acoustic cortex, i.e., Brodmann’s area 41 of Heschl’s
gyrus (Figs. 4c, 5c–d, 6a–b). As demonstrated in Fig. 3e, for
example, the acoustic radiation of the left hemisphere forms an
‘‘S’’-shaped course when leaving the medial geniculate body and
runs through the temporal stem. Below Heschl’s gyrus, the fibers
change direction at a very sharp angle of about 60-.
Two association pathways, the inferior occipito-frontal and
uncinate fascicles, have a close relationship to the optic and
acoustic fiber tracts. The inferior occipito-frontal fascicle runs
through the temporal isthmus, where it is located in the notch
between the acoustic and optic radiations. The latter is also known
as Meyer’s loop (Glaser, 1978) (Figs. 4c, 6a+b). Laterally, the
inferior occipito-frontal fascicle accompanies the uncinate fasciculus. It ascends to the frontobasal white matter at the level of the
temporal horn of the lateral ventricle (Figs. 4a, 5d–f, 6b).
Medially, the uncinate fascicle approaches the inferior occipitofrontal fascicle and runs through the temporal isthmus from the
frontal lobe to the mesial temporal lobe (Figs. 4a, 5e+f, 6b+c). The
uncinate fascicle is near the optic radiation at the turning point of
the latter (Meyer’s loop).
The main efferent system of the hippocampus is the fornix. It
starts as a thin layer of fibers on the surface of the hippocampus
(‘‘fimbria’’, Figs. 4c, 6e). The fibers leave the hippocampus at the


level of the splenium of the corpus callosum. The fornices of both
hemispheres run in a rostro-medial direction along the roof of the
lateral ventricle (crura of the fornix; Figs. 4c–d). The left and the
right fornices abut each other in the midline (body of fornix; Figs.
4a+b). Rostral to the intraventricular foramen, the fibers descend
(column of fornix) and then run caudally to the mamillary bodies
(Figs. 4b, 5f). The mamillary bodies project via the mamillothalamic tract to the anterior nucleus of the thalamus.
In turn, the anterior thalamic neurons project to the cingulate
cortex, especially the posterior ones, and to the hippocampus.
Those fibers travel in the cingulum. The cingulum, which is
located interior to the cingulate gyrus, forms a compact pathway
running in a fronto-occipital direction. In addition to efferents from
the anterior thalamic nucleus, the cingulum contains both long and
short association fibers, which connect the prefrontal lobes with
posterior cortices, including the hippocampal formation. The
cingulum bends around the splenium (isthmus of cingulate gyrus;
Figs. 4a–e, 5a, 6a) and turns ventro-rostrally into the white matter
of the medial occipito-temporal gyrus (Armstrong, 1990).
The stereotaxic coordinates of the fiber tracts and nuclei were
determined in all brains and hemispheres. The maximal extent of
the fiber tracts and nuclei was defined in the coronal, sagittal and
horizontal planes of the standard reference space for all ten brains
(Figs. 4–6, Table 3).
Data concerning the stereotaxic location of tracts and regions
were compared to those in the Talairach (Talairach and Tournoux,
1988) atlas (Table 4). The present data, however, go beyond the
information provided in this atlas by adding information about
right-hemispheric fibers and nuclei. The optic and the acoustic
radiations have bilaterally asymmetric rostral extents, which differ
by up to 1 cm. The spatial extent of fibers and nuclei had larger
ranges than found in the corresponding Talairach data. The left
corticospinal tract, for example, reaches from horizontal (z)
coordinates 88 to �21, whereas the Talairach atlas gives the most
ventral level at z = 16. The same is true for nuclei. The location of
the lateral geniculate body in the x coordinate, for example, may
vary by several millimeters.

Intersubject variability in location and extent

The size, stereotaxic location and shape of the fiber tracts varied
considerably among the ten brains (Fig. 3). Therefore, we
calculated probability maps for the fiber tracts and their related
nuclei (Figs. 7–16). The course, extent and variability of each
structure were demonstrated in numerous sections of the three
orthogonal planes. In the following paragraphs, we describe
probability maps, which illustrate the variability in selected
sectioning planes. Complete volumetric data of fiber tracts and
nuclei can be obtained at http://www.fz-juelich.de/ime.

Corticospinal tract

Figs. 8a–u demonstrate the spatial variability of the corticospinal tract analyzed in the present study. Two interesting aspects
were observed: (i) the degree of intersubject variability shifts
along its course, with the highest variability found immediately
below the primary motor cortex (e.g., Fig. 7d). The variability
decreases (more overlap among the ten brains) in the corona
radiata close to the internal capsule. The lowest variability
(highest overlap) was found within the internal capsule. Below
the internal capsule, the variability of the corticospinal tract

Coordinates are in anatomical MNI space (orientation according the AC–PC line) and refer to the maximal extents of the whole sample of ten brains in each
direction. x is the distance in millimeters to the right (+) or to the left (�) of the midsagittal line; y is the distance anterior (+) or posterior (�) to the vertical
plane through the anterior commissure; z is the distance above (+) or below (�) the intercommissural line (AC–PC line). The corpus callosum and the fornix
cross the midline of the brain and, therefore, were only defined by their most lateral x coordinates (i.e., from the most left position to the most right one). The
optic radiation is located close to the midline. Its left-hemispheric portion reaches slightly into the right stereotaxic space. Such a shift has already been shown
for area 17 (i.e., the target of the optic radiation; Amunts et al., 2000) and is related to macroscopical asymmetry of the brain shape. Sup. long. fasc.—superior

increased again, reaching an overlap of about 60–80% just before
entering the brainstem. (ii) The intersubject variability of the
corticospinal tract differed between the hemispheres. This tract
was less variable in the left than in the right hemisphere. No
differences in variability were found in this or the following tracts
with respect to gender.

Optic radiation

The optic radiation (Figs. 8a–u) was more variable than the
corticospinal tract. Variability was low near the lateral geniculate
body, i.e., in the isthmus of the temporal lobe (Figs. 8l+m) and in
the posterior part of the tract. The lateral geniculate body showed a
very low variability in location. A 100% overlap of the lateral
geniculate bodies of the ten brains was found in some voxels in the
right hemisphere, but not in the left. Thus, an interhemispheric
difference in the degree of variability was observed. In contrast to

the corticospinal tract, the optic radiation was less variable in the
right than left hemisphere.

Acoustic radiation

The acoustic radiation (Figs. 10a–c) showed a higher degree of
variability than the optic radiation. At the origin of the acoustic
radiation from the rostro-lateral part of the medial geniculate body,
the overlap was only about 30–50%. While ascending into the
white matter of the transverse gyrus of Heschl, the variability
decreased, and a maximal overlap of 90% was reached. The
location of the medial geniculate body also varied considerably
between the brains. A maximum overlap of only 70% was found.
A clear interhemispheric difference was not seen.

Fornix and cingulum

The fibers of the fornix (Figs. 11a–c) showed an overlap of
70–90% (maximal overlap of 100% in a few voxels) ventral to the
splenium of the corpus callosum. In contrast, maximal variability
(overlap 30–50%) was found both in the fimbria and the columns
of the fornix. The mamillary bodies revealed a moderate variability
(overlap 60–80%). The cingulum (Figs. 12a–c) showed an even
higher variability in the precallosal region (approximately 30–50%
overlap). While running through the isthmus of the cingulate gyrus
and towards the parahippocampal gyrus, the overlap increased up
to 100%.

Commissural and association pathways

The highest overlap of individual fibers was found in the corpus
callosum (Figs. 9a–u). Extended regions with a 100% overlap
were located in the splenium, the trunk and the genu. The
variability of the corpus callosum increased slightly in the
splenium as compared to the trunk and the genu.

individual brains. For example, yellow means that 8 of 10 tracts overlapped in this particular voxel. Designations as above.


Long-association fiber tracts

The superior longitudinal fascicle connects mainly occipital
(Brodmann’s areas 18 and 19) with lateral frontal association
cortices (Figs. 13a–c) and has a considerably lower overlap
(approximately 40–60%) than the corpus callosum. Maximal
overlap (100% in a few voxels) was found in a small region
between the insula and the corticospinal fibers.


The variability of the superior occipito-frontal fascicle (Figs.
14a–c) was high. This was particularly true for its occipital part,
which is located medial to the corticospinal fibers. A slightly
higher degree of overlap was found more frontally, at the transition
of the caput to the corpus of the caudate nucleus. The inferior
occipito-frontal fascicle runs through the isthmus of the temporal
lobe medial to the lower insula (Figs. 15a–c), where it showed an
overlap of 70–90%. The fibers spread out from there in frontal and

occipital directions, and the variability increased (overlap of
approximately 30–50%). Finally, the uncinate fascicle (Figs.
16a–c) overlapped at a level of approximately 40–70%.

Discussion

The aim of the present study was to provide stereotaxic maps of
important fiber tracts and associated nuclei based on their


microscopic appearance in histological myelin-stained sections.
The application of a modified Heidenhain–Woelcke staining
method, developed to identify fiber tracts in histological sections
of adult human brains by our group (Bu¨rgel et al., 1999), enabled
us to map them. The fibers were warped to the anatomical MNI
reference space, a widely used reference space for functional and
anatomical MR studies. The individual variability in 3-D topography and size of fiber tracts and nuclei was quantified by
calculating probability maps of fiber tracts and nuclei. This

stereotaxic information is superior to that of the Talairach atlas
(Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) in several respects—(i) it is based
on a microscopic delineation, and (ii) it shows and quantifies
interhemispheric and intersubject differences in the extent and
location of fibers and nuclei.
The microscopic mapping may result in a more precise
delineation of fiber tracts and enables mapping in some
portions of fiber tracts that are beyond the resolution of


alternative mapping tools, e.g., MRI, DT-MRI. Better spatial
resolution is particularly helpful in regions where fibers spread
out, as when the fibers of the corpus callosum approach the
cortical ribbon or when fibers come into close contact with
neighboring fiber tracts. The latter situation was found, for
example, where the corticospinal tract runs through the brain
stem. With our method, we were able to follow the corticospinal tract to z = �21.

High spatial resolution and thin slices are also required in the
region of the temporal isthmus where the acoustic radiation forms
an ‘‘S’’-shaped curve as it runs towards Heschl’s gyrus and where
other major fiber tracts having multiple fiber directions run within
a few millimeters of the acoustic fibers. Without high resolution,
the abrupt changes in fiber direction cannot be detected. Resolution
limits of current DT-MRI may also interfere with the detection of


minor nuclei, which have a diameter of only a few millimeters and
poor contrast (e.g., the medial geniculate body). These regions
were not problematic in our myelo- and cytoarchitectonic studies.
The quality and precision of the maps of some fiber tracts were
improved by defining the starting and end points according to
microscopically defined cortical areas. We used such information
for the corticospinal tract, the optic and acoustic radiations. These

tracts have a high degree of overlap. Source and end points were
missing for long-association fiber tracts, where the precise anatomy
of the interconnected areas is less well known. This lack of
precision may lead to an underestimation of association fiber tract
lengths.
The present maps showed that the delineated fiber tracts and
nuclei varied considerably between the brains. In our data, different
sources of variability include: (i) brain shape and size, (ii) position
and course of the fiber tracts, as well as their origins and targets
(e.g., cytoarchitectonic areas, subcortical nuclei) and (iii) methodologies. Gross anatomical variability (i) is the major source of
variability (Ono et al., 1990); it ranges from several millimeters to
centimeters but is largely eliminated by registration procedures.
Cortical folding, especially during development, may produce fiber
tract variability (Yakovlev and Lecours, 1967; McArdle et al.,
1987; Barkovich et al., 1988; Pujol et al., 1993, 2004; Giedd et al.,
1999; Paus et al., 2001, Mangin et al., 2004). A second source is
microstructural variability (ii) in cortical and subcortical areas that
remains after registration (Geyer et al., 1996; Amunts et al., 2000;
Rademacher et al., 2002) and therefore influences the variability of
the fiber tracts starting from or targeting these areas. This kind of
variability is quantified by the probability maps. In addition to this
biological variability, certain methods, in particular the non-linear
elastic registration (iii), adds some variability. As this is minor, we
focus on the second source of variability.
A high degree of overlap, and thus a low intersubject
variability, was found in the corticospinal tract and the corpus
callosum. To a lesser extent, this was also true in the optic tract.
The corticospinal tract and the optic radiation start to myelinate
early during ontogeny, the former in the 9th fetal month and the
latter around birth (Yakovlev and Lecours, 1967). MR studies of
the developing human brain have shown that the internal capsule,
the optic radiation and the corpus callosum are among the first to
myelinate (for an overview, see Paus et al., 2001). In contrast, longassociation fibers, e.g., the superior longitudinal fascicle, and the
superior and inferior occipito-frontal fascicles myelinate relatively
late (Yakovlev and Lecours, 1967). These fiber tracts have less
overlap and more individual variability. It might therefore be
speculated that the earlier the fiber tracts are established, the lower
the variability.
The acoustic radiation does not fit into this scheme, however. It
starts myelinating at the same time as the optic radiation
(approximately 3 months postnatal) but shows more variability
than the latter. The acoustic and the optic radiations, however,
differ with respect to the end points of myelination: this occurs at
approximately 4 months for the optic radiation, but at 4 years for
the acoustic radiation. This suggests that both the beginning of
myelination and its time course influence localization variability.
The postnatal ending of myelination also suggests that individual
experiences, for example, the languages that the infant is exposed
to, might influence variability of acoustic connections more than
visual ones.
Our data show that a fiber tract with a lot of variability may
be located in close proximity to a tract having low variability.
The superior occipito-frontal fascicle, for example, varied
considerably in its occipital part, even though that part is located
close to corticospinal fibers, which have lower variability. Thus,
variability is associated both with a tract’s stereotaxic location
and its nature.
It is interesting to note that variability was particularly low in
regions where the density of fibers was extremely high, as


observed in the internal capsule, close to the lateral geniculate
body, at the isthmus of the temporal lobe and in the most central
parts of the corpus callosum and fornix. These regions are of
particular importance with respect to the functional deficits after
brain lesions as even small lesions within these regions may cause
severe functional deficits.
In conclusion: (i) the stereotaxic maps of ten fiber tracts and
three associated nuclei enable a probability-based identification of
fiber tracts, invisible in routine, T1-weighted MRIs of the living
human brain, (ii) the intersubject variability of the fiber tracts and
nuclei differs according to the fiber tract and its particular location,
(iii) the stereotaxic coordinates, which are provided by the
Talairach (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988) atlas, underestimate the
extent and size of the fiber tracts and nuclei and do not represent a
reliable and precise anatomical reference of fiber tracts and (iv)
comparing microstructurally defined fiber tracts with data obtained
in DT-MRI and tractography (as published recently by Mori et al.,
2005; Wakana et al., 2004) permits researchers to evaluate in vivo
fiber tracking in detail.
