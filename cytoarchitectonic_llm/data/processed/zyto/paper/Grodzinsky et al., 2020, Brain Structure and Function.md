**Abstract**
High-level cognitive capacities that serve communication, reasoning, and calculation are essential for finding our way in the
world. But whether and to what extent these complex behaviors share the same neuronal substrate are still unresolved questions. The present study separated the aspects of logic from language and numerosity—mental faculties whose distinctness
has been debated for centuries—and identified a new cytoarchitectonic area as correlate for an operation involving logical
negation. A novel experimental paradigm that was implemented here in an RT/fMRI study showed a single cluster of activity that pertains to logical negation. It was distinct from clusters that were activated by numerical comparison and from the
traditional language regions. The localization of this cluster was described by a newly identified cytoarchitectonic area in
the left anterior insula, ventro-medial to Broca’s region. We provide evidence for the congruence between the histologically
and functionally defined regions on multiple measures. Its position in the left anterior insula suggests that it functions as a
mediator between language and reasoning areas.

The relation between linguistic, logical, and numerical
abilities has long been debated. All three use formal rules
to string smaller meaning-bearing forms into bigger ones,
in a manner that ensures rich expressiveness. The thought
that these emanate from one and the same neurocognitive
system may thus be natural. Indeed, Aristotle believed that
language and logic go hand in hand, as did the seventieth
century Port Royal logicians/grammarians (cf. Gabbay
et al. 2006; Chomsky and McGilvray 2009 for a historical
perspective). Many modern linguists likewise believe that
language and logic are interwoven in the human mind,
which hosts a “natural logic…, a theory about the logical
structure of natural language sentences and the regularities governing the notion of a valid argument for reasoning
in natural language” (Lakoff 1970). But prominent philosophers in the modern era, notably Frege and Russell,
thought otherwise and argued for their distinctness (van
Heijenoort 1967). Many among these logicians focused
on logic as a vehicle for undoing language-induced confusions, cognition being of lesser relevance. But their
analyses, if valid, could well be couched in a cognitive

framework. Thus the debate on the status of logic in linguistic communication and reasoning is real and it persists to this day in philosophy, psychology, and linguistics
(Montague 1974; Horn 1989; Monti and Osherson 2012).
George Lakoff described the issue succinctly: “Natural logic,” he said, “taken together with linguistics, is the
empirical study of the nature of human language and human
reasoning. It can have right and wrong answers” (Lakoff
1970). We took this dictum seriously and searched for relevant evidence from neuroscience.
We were also aware that the relation between linguistic
and arithmetical abilities has similarly generated controversy
(Chomsky 1988; Henschen 1920; Makuuchi et al. 2012;
Changeux et al. 1998). To a cognitive neuroscientist, then,
the question of whether logical, linguistic, and arithmetical abilities emanate from one and the same neurocognitive
system is empirical, one that has not yet been fully resolved.
These observations led us to an empirical excursion involving logic, language, and arithmetic that consisted of three
stages: (I) functional: we produced behavioral and neuroimaging evidence pointing to the distinctness of linguistic, logical, and numerical functions in a group of healthy
subjects (Dehaene et al. 2003; Deschamps et al. 2015). (II)
Anatomical: we uncovered the neuroanatomical properties
of a relevant cortical area in a series of postmortem brains,
analyzed its microstructure, and created a three-dimensional,
cytoarchitectonic map. (III) Integration of neuroimaging and
microstructural data: we demonstrated a high degree of overlap between the anatomical and the functional, suggesting a
unit of functional anatomy.
The functional distinctness of language and logic was
investigated through sentences with and without logical
negation, an elemental operation known to incur substantial processing cost (Deschamps et al. 2015). The task we
used, moreover, enabled us to investigate the distinctness
of numerosity from logic and language: participants heard
sentences that required a comparison between two quantities and were asked to verify these sentences against visual
images. To study the functional distinctness of arithmetic,
we manipulated the difficulty of numerical comparison by
tinkering with the properties of these visual images. This
technique enables us to probe the brain’s numerical comparison modules and at the same time language and logic were
probed. In sum, a single complex experiment allowed us to
compare neural aspects of language, logic, and numerosity.
Indices for processing complexity and anatomical loci
of activity were reaction time (RT) and fMRI signal intensity. Anatomical distinctness was studied by subjecting the
area in the vicinity of the single region that the fMRI study
uncovered (the left anterior insula) to cytoarchitectonic analysis and the JuBrain atlas (Amunts and Zilles 2015). This
analysis revealed a new, cytoarchitectonically uniform brain
area, which turned out to be distinct from regions known to

## 1 3


support language and numerosity, but overlapped with the
functionally defined negation area.

### Materials and methods

The fMRI experiment was approved by the ethics committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI). Twentythree participants, recruited at McGill University, were
tested. Two were excluded due to technical problems during
scanning. All were right-handed as assessed by the Edinburgh Handedness Inventory (Russell 1903), native English speakers with normal hearing, and corrected to normal
vision (mean age 23.6 SD = ± 4.5; range 19–35; 13 females).
Participants gave informed consent in accordance with
the ethics committee of the Montreal Neurological Institute (MNI) and the Helsinki Declaration of 1975 (revised
1983). The behavioral task performed inside the magnet is
described in the text and in Fig. 1. The anatomical data were
obtained from ten human postmortem brains (five males, five
females). Donors, who had no clinical history of neurological or psychiatric disease, were reached through the body
donor program of the University of Duesseldorf, in accordance to the guidelines of the ethics committee. A detailed
description of the properties of the experimental materials,
the behavioral, anatomical, and imaging methods and data
analyses are given in the SI Appendix.

#### Logical negation and language

Negation (¬) was defined by ancient Greek logicians as a
logical operator that reverses the truth value of a proposition: if p, the proposition expressed by a sentence, is true,
then ¬p is false and vice versa (Ross and Smith 1928). As a
consequence, negation reverses the direction of inferences:
_p →_ _q is equivalent to ¬q →_ _¬p. This can be demonstrated_
through a language example: Take p = I own a dog, q = I own
_an animal. If we assume that all dogs are animals ({x: x is a_
dog} ⊂ {x: x is an animal}), then q is true whenever p is true.
We can therefore conclude that p → _q. But note that negation_
reverses the direction of the inference: I don’t own an ani_mal → I don’t own a dog. Linguistic negation, then, produces_
effects in keeping with propositional logic, and specifically,
abides by the well-known equivalence p → _q⇔¬q →_ _¬p._
In cognitive neuroscience, studies have investigated the
neural reflections of words that express negation (e.g., no,
_not) (Bahlmann et al. 2011; Tettamanti et al. 2008). Here,_
however, we sought evidence for a sharper distinction—
we sought to dissociate language from logic. For that, we
needed to distill logic from language—to extract logical
operators from stimuli that contain them implicitly, even
though they lack a corresponding word. Language avails
us of tools to express negation implicitly. One of these is


-----

**Fig. 1 Design.** **a Trials: auditory sentence probes or incrementally**
presented visual expressions. At a fixed point, a proportion-depicting
image appeared. Task: to indicate whether or not the image matched
the probe. Auditory and visual probes had the same content. **b The**
processes involved in the analysis of linguistic stimuli: Phase I triggered phonetic, morphophonological and syntactic analyses, followed
by semantic analysis that produced content—a formal meaning representation encoding a proportion between two numerosities; Phase
II required image analysis: estimation of the numerosities of the two
clusters of colored circled, followed by a comparison. Verification
was the step where participants decided about the match between
Phase I and Phase II representations. **c Design: the experiment fea-**
tured three factors (Polarity, Probe type, Proportion). The first two
had two levels each (a), each presented with six tokens of five different proportions, ­p1–p5

a class of polar quantifiers—quantity-denoting expressions
that come in pairs, e.g., <more, less>. Here, we show that
_less, but not more, contains an implicit negation that is pre-_
sent logically (e.g., it reverses truth-value and thus inference
direction), but absent morphophonologically (“Materials and
methods”).
To be convinced that the meaning of less indeed contains implicit negation, note that if he drank more beer
_than wine is true, then he drank less beer than wine is_
false—truth value is reversed upon replacement of more
by less. But this is not sufficient evidence. To be convinced
that the meaning of less actually contains an implicit negation, let us use the inference reversal test demonstrated
above for explicit negation (not): like in the affirmative
sentence above, and given that all dogs are animals ({x: x


is a dog} ⊂ {x: x is an animal}), we can safely infer from
“more than half of my friends own a dog” that “more than
_half of my friends own an animal”. Now, consider how_
_less induces an inference reversal, when it replaces more:_
if less than half of my friends do not own an animal, we
can safely infer that less than half of my friends do not
_own a dog. This pattern of inferential relations between_
sentences, identical to those observed above with explicit
negation, indicates that one member of the _more/less_
pair implicitly contains a negation. Evidence adduced by
semanticists indicates that less is the one (see “Materials and methods”). Seeking to test the separation between
logic and language through negation, we constructed sentence stimuli that contained the complex quantifiers more/
_less than half._
Phase I sentence probes with more or less, thus had the
same surface syntax, an identical number of words and
syllables, and they unfolded in time in exactly the same
way. The resulting meanings were identical up to negation, as their truth conditions were reversed—when one
was true, the other was false and vice versa. Purely logical
negation—which seems to be hidden in less (“Materials
and methods”)—could thus be extracted. Our goal was to
detect processing differences between more and less, and
uncover the cerebral loci supporting these computations.
Yet, additional differences between the sentence probes
required controls: more and less are different words with
different lexical frequencies; as well, they induce reversed
linear sequences of the two compared set cardinalities.
These differences might matter. To control these differences, a pair of inequality symbols was used {<, >}, to
construct non-language, quasi-algebraic, visual probes
(Deschamps et al. 2015) that unfolded in time during
Phase I (Fig. 1a). Probes with these elemental symbols
were proper controls: like the quantifier pair, they denote
a relation between two set cardinalities in reverse orders
(p > q = q < p); unlike quantifiers, they are atomic, none
contains a negation, and they have the same perceptual
contour (“Materials and methods”).
Phase I probes thus featured a Probe type factor (+linguistic {more, less}; –linguistic {>, <}) and a Polarity
factor (positive {more, >}; negative {less, <}). Our design
dictated a focus on the processing signature of negation:
the effect of negation (less–more) minus the specific symbol and reversal effects of the control conditions (<–>).
That is, we expected to find a difference between differences or a Net Negation Interaction signature during Phase
I—a Probe type X Polarity interaction between the two
Phase I factors (NetNegInt = ∆“Less”–“More”> ∆“<”–“>”,
which we will later cash in with specific units), which
moreover stems from a negative Polarity signal that is
higher than the positive.

#### Verification and numerosity

Each trial in our bi-phasic speeded verification task had a
Phase I auditory sentence or a visual quasi-algebraic expression that was about a proportion between two sets of colored
circles. Phase II featured an image, depicting a proportion
between quantities of blue and yellow circles (Fig. 1a). Participants were asked to verify the sentence against the image
as fast as they could. This task required the comprehension
of a probe in Phase I, numerical estimation of each of the
two quantities in the Phase II image (blue/yellow circles)
followed by a comparison between them, and a decision
(Fig. 1b).
In the Phase II images, the numerosity of one quantity
was fixed across images and the other was modified parametrically (Fig. 1c). The resulting blue/yellow proportions
influenced task difficulty, leading to a Comparison effect
(Comp): task difficulty (measured by the RT) was expected
to predict the relative values of the dependent variables, as
well as test whether these variables behave in accordance
with Weber’s Law (Vogel et al. 2013). The two effects—
_NetNegInt and Comp—are already known to be independent_
(Deschamps et al. 2015).
The Phase I probes and the Phase II images had identical conceptual content and the proportion between blue
and yellow circles made the probes true or false. Each part
contributed its share to the overall processing cost, which
was behaviorally indexed by RT, time-locked to the end of
Phase I.

### Results

#### Behavioral tests

The 21 participants who performed the verification task during the scanning session (“Materials and methods”), exhibited low error rates (84% ± 4% correct responses per participant across all conditions) and exhibited the NetNegInt
signature (Fig. 2a): the negation effect within the linguistic
pair of condition was very robust: mean ­RTless= 1035.3 ms
(SD = 313.2); mean ­RTmore= 882.8 (SD = 287) led to a very
high significance on a paired-sample _t test (t(20) = 7.33,_
_p = 2.19e−0). The effect for the non-linguistic pair was_
less strong: mean ­RT< = 971.4 ms (SD = 330.7); mean
­RT> = 888 ms (SD = 277.7), a paired-sample _t test_
(t(20) = 3.947, p = 0.0008). The linguistic effect, moreover,
was manifested individually for almost all participants
(Fig. 2b), as well as across all blue/yellow proportions in the
Phase II images (Fig. 2c). The judgment times (on a logarithmic scale) were analyzed in a repeated-measures ANOVA.
The NetNegInt signature thus took the following shape, replicating previous results: (1) a significant Probe type X Polarity interaction (F(1,20) = 9.18, p = 0.007); (2) the source of
the interaction was: ∆RT“Less”–“More”> ∆RT“<”–“>”.
An additional factor that affected RT was the proportion between the number of blue and yellow circles in the
image: the experiment featured five red/yellow proportions
­(p1–p5 in Fig. 1c), sentence verification required image
scanning and numerical comparison, which is subject to

proportion of circles visual probe (SEM). The x-axis is compressed
logarithmically. d Gaussians fitted to the data from c before and after
log compression show a greater R[2] subsequent to compression, indicating compliance with Weber’s Law

this law (Fig. 2d). Thus, we could test whether participants performed in keeping with Weber’s Law. Mean RT
across participants for the verification of each proportion was computed, a Gaussian was fitted to these means
and the coefficient of determination (R[2]) was calculated.
The fit of the performance curve to a Gaussian improved
when the _x-axis (blue/yellow proportion) was logarith-_
mic (R[2]log compressed[ = 0.995, right panel) compared to linear ]
(R[2]linear[ = 0.927, left panel).]
The effects of negation and proportion on RT were independent: a Gaussian with three parameters (baseline, amplitude and width) was fitted to the set of RT values of the more
and less conditions (Fig. 2b) and a permutation test was conducted. The baseline parameter reflects RT effect due only
to negation. Only this parameter yielded a significant difference between the conditions (p < 0.00003), indicating that
RT effects due to proportion and those due to negation were
independent. Past behavioral results (NetNetInt signature),
as well as results pertaining to the modularity of linguistic
and arithmetical processing, were thus replicated, this time
during an imaging session (Deschamps et al. 2015).

#### Fmri

The analysis of fMRI data had two goals: (1) to identify
brain loci supporting logical negation, the NegNetInt signature as a proxy; (2) to test the neural separation between
linguistic, logical, and numerical processes. Our design, in
which probes and images were present sequentially (Phases
I, II), enabled to distinguish them analytically.

**Phase I**

A whole brain analysis of the Phase I BOLD activity patterns revealed two clusters that manifested the NetNegInt
signature:

a. at the left anterior insula (NetNegInt: _F1,20 = 21.84,_
_p = 0.00015, corrected, see “Materials and methods”;_
Fig. 4b, Phase I panel). In this cluster, a main Polarity effect was also found (F1,20 = 38.04, p = 0.000005,
corrected). In the linguistic conditions, the activation
of the negative quantifier (PSC = 0.25%, SEM = 0.031)
was higher than that of the positive one (PSC = 0.2%,
SEM = 0.03). A paired-sample t test was highly significant (t(20), p < 0.0000001). No significant difference
between the non-linguistic conditions (<, >) was found.
b. at the Superior Temporal Gyrus (STG), (NetNegInt:
_F1,20 = 37.44, p = 0.000006, corrected, Fig. 4c, Phase I_
panel). This cluster also exhibited a main effect of Polarity (F1,20 = 10.10, p = 0.005), where the negative quantifier produced a higher activation (0.21 ± 0.22) than the
positive quantifier (0.13 ± 0.22), a statistically significant


increase of 0.07 ± 0.05 (t(20) = 6.3, p = 0.000004). No significant difference between the non-linguistic conditions
<, > was found.

**Phase II**

The Phase II BOLD response for numerical comparison
(Comp), measured during and after image display, was
detected using RT as a predictor (“Materials and methods”). As task difficulty was in keeping with Weber’s Law
(Fig. 2d), RT could be used as a proxy for the Comp effect
(Vogel et al. 2013). A parietal Comp effect was recorded
bilaterally (Table 1, Fig. 3b). This result, while new for the
present task, is consistent with previous ones that have identified similar regions as supporting numerical comparison
(Heim et al. 2012; Piazza et al. 2004).
Next, we explored the Phase II activation patterns of the
two NetNegInt masks from Phase I (Fig. 3a) to see whether
the NetNegInt signature persists across both phases. The
cluster on the left anterior insula (NetNegInt cluster henceforth) was the only one to exhibit this signature, indicating
that negation is still active in the representation to be verified
at trial’s end:

a. at the left anterior insula (NetNegInt: F(1,20) = 31.003,
_p = 0.000019, corrected, Fig._ 4b, Phase II panel). A
paired-sample t test for the linguistic condition compared
the percent signal change (PSC) for the negative quantifier
highly significant (t(20) = 8.698, p = 0.00000003, 2-tailed),
with the negative condition producing higher activation
than the positive one. No difference was found for the
non-linguistic condition (<, >, t(20) = 0.762, p − 0.455).
b. at the STG, all activations were negative. Such deactivations are typically associated with the Default Network
(of which the STG is sometimes thought to be part) and
their interpretation in the context of a task remains elusive. Importantly, though, this all-around negative pattern is substantially different from any of the activation
patterns reported above.

#### Behavior/signal intensity correlations

In the insular NegNetInt cluster, the fine behavioral and
fMRI NetNegInt effects, calculated at the individual participant level, were correlated in both phases and were found to
be significant for both phases (Phase I: r = 0.402, p = 0.035,
Fig. 4b bottom panel; Phase II: r = 0.432, p = 0.025, both
1-tailed). The same analysis, carried out on the STG cluster, detected no significant behavioral/fMRI signal intensity
correlation (Phase I: r = − 0.12, p = 0.603, Fig. 4c, bottom
panel; Phase II: r = − 0.193, p = 0.2).

(yellow), with a main effect of Instruction (F1,20 = 8.16, p = 0.010), a

#### Uniqueness and cohesion of the insular cluster

In sum, the left anterior insular NetNegInt cluster was unique
in exhibiting three critical properties that indicate functional
cohesion: (a) the _NetNegInt signature. (b) A significant_
positive correlation between the individual NetNegInt brain
activity index (BOLD signal intensity) and its behavioral RT
analog. (c) Persistence of both effects across Phases I–II, that
is, during both the construction of a meaning representation
and its verification against the image.
Next, the functional uniqueness of the insular NetNegInt
cluster in both Phases I and II was tested, by identifying
putative joint activities with clusters associated with other
parts of the tasks. First, conjunction analyses on both the
insular NetNegInt and Comp functional clusters detected no
significant joint activity, indicating the anatomical disjointness of logical and numerical operations.
Finally, anatomical ROI analyses of _JuBrain-defined_
areas 44, 45, viewed as classical language areas (Amunts
et al. 1999; Amunts et al. 2004), were also conducted for
both the NetNegInt and the Comp effects. No significant
effect was found in the region of both anterior language
areas, indicating the anatomical disjointness of logical and
linguistic operations. Third, the left temporal pole, a region
claimed to support combinatorial semantics (Anderson et al.
2017; Del Prato and Pylkkänen 2014), was silent, but began
to surface as an active NetNegInt site once the threshold was
dropped to a low, uncorrected p < 0.07. Linguistic activity,


Phase I main effect of Polarity (F1,20 = 10.10, p = 0.005) and an interaction between Instruction and Polarity (F1,20 = 37.44, p = 0.000006).
**b Phase II** _Comp effect: the left and right clusters in which a Comp_
effect was significant (Table 1). A conjunction analysis between the
_Comp and NetNegInt clusters revealed no overlap_

logical negation, and numerical operation (numerosity),
then, were clearly dissociated. This uniqueness and cohesion pointed to the left anterior insula as a new region of
interest, which we proceeded to characterize anatomically.

#### Cytoarchitectonic map

To identify the precise anatomical correlates of this region,
we analyzed cytoarchitectonically the anterior insula in
histological sections of ten human postmortem brains
(five males, five females; Table 2). Image analysis and an
observer-independent procedure relying on multivariate statistical analysis were used to define areal borders and quantify inter-areal differences (Amunts et al. 1999). We identified and mapped a new cytoarchitectonic area, Id7 (Insular
dysgranular area 7), located on the latero-dorsal surface of
the anterior short insular gyrus of both hemispheres (Figs. 5,
6). Area Id7 is a six-layered, dysgranular area, characterized
by an interrupted and inconspicuous inner granular layer
(layer IV). The mean volume of Id7 is 421 mm[3] (SD = 146)
on the left and 354 mm[3] (SD = 129) on right hemisphere
(corrected for shrinkage). Inter-hemispheric cytoarchitectonic analysis did not show any significant left–right
asymmetry (paired sample t test = p > 0.05; “Materials and
methods”).

#### Precise functional anatomy of negation

Next, the functional cluster was superimposed on the new
anatomical area, to study the extent of overlap and topographical relationship. The voxels contained in both NetNegInt
cluster and Id7 amounted to 29.2% of the anatomical volume
and to 19.2% of the functional volume (once resampled for
1 mm[3] anatomical voxels). The remainder, being in the white
matter, was deemed to be a methodical artifact. Both clusters

of Id7 in representative coronal, axial, and sagittal sections. Dark red
and dark blue regions represent, respectively, areas with high (9–10
brains) and low overlap. The coordinates correspond to the stereotaxic position of the sections in anatomical MNI space (63)

45 of Broca’s region (Fig. 7). The NetNegInt cluster’s peak
of activation (− 30, 26, 8) was located within the anatomical
Id7 at a probability p = 0.91, substantially higher than any
analogous value found (Table 1). Moreover, the Centers of
Mass of the anatomical probabilistic map (− 32, 23, 4) and
the NetNegInt functional cluster (− 32, 26, 8) were closely
related to one other (Fig. 7, see Supplementary Movie).
Finally, an anatomical ROI-based analysis, using a threshold map of the left Id7 (“Materials and methods”), also
revealed a significant NetNegInt effect (F = 6.258, p < 0.02).

task. An expansion of Fig. 3d: the visualization here is a threedimensional reconstruction of a brain: the left frontal lobe is gradually removed to show the spatial relations between the fMRI activation cluster (magenta) and the cytoanatomically defined region Id7
(blue), as well as areas 44 (red) and 45 (yellow) in Broca’s region.
The blue and red dots indicate the centers of mass of region Id7 and
the fMRI cluster, respectively. The functional activation cluster and
area Id7 overlap to a large extent, and are clearly separated from areas
in Broca’s region. Op7 opercular area 7, Id7 insular dysgranular area

### Discussion

Taken together, the anatomical and functional clusters
exhibit bi-uniqueness: area Id7 is cytoarchitectonically
distinct from its neighbors, and represents a new, independent cortical area of the anterior insula (Fig. 7, Movie).
The functional NetNegInt coincides largely with Id7, overlaps with no other cortical region, and NetNegInt intensity
correlates with RT at the individual participant level.
At a minimum, these results allow us to conclude that
there is a single, anatomically and functionally cohesive
core area involved in negation—Id7/NetNegInt. It is distinct
from areas 44, 45, long believed to support syntax and from
areas supporting core compositional semantic processes in
the left temporal pole (Del Prato and Pylkkänen 2014). This
distinctness and cohesiveness illustrates how relatively
small elements of cognition can be neurally individuated
and correlated with cytoarchitectonically defined areas.
It also supports a modular view of cognitive functioning
(Fodor 1983) and moreover seems to provide an answer,
albeit partial, to the perennial debate about language and
logic. If evidence from neuroscience bears on the debate,
then Frege, Russell, and their followers were right: language
and at least some aspects of logic are distinct. Finally, our
results suggest that the border between the insula and Broca’s region is where language stops and logic begins.


We are not in a position to establish a connection
between our results and other roles attributed to the anterior insula such as interoception. Yet, there is a difference in pattern: typically, the anterior insula is activated
bilaterally (Zaccarella and Friederici 2015), and tends
to co-activate with the anterior cingulate (Craig 2009;
Engstrom et al. 2014), to which the left and right insulae
appear to be massively connected (Mesulam and Mufson
1982) and have a similar histologic makeup (Ghaziri et al.
2017). Our study documented no bi-lateral co-activation.
Recent lesion data, moreover, relate interoceptive deficits
to regions that seem to exclude the here defined left Id7
(Salomon et al. 2018).
So what can we conclude and where do we go from here?
Our experiment demonstrates that the processing of one logical connective, ¬, has a distinct neurocognitive signature,
supported by a histologically coherent piece of neural tissue,
the left Id7, that is, outside the traditional language regions,
lying between them and decision making areas. While we
believe that this set of findings provides the basis for an
important argument for language–logic dissociation, we are
aware that it is based on a single set of results, one that needs
to be further enriched in the same spirit. Convergent results
from related explorations of other logical connectives will
no doubt help to bolster our claims. E.g., if experiments can
be designed to successfully isolate disjunction, conjunction,
and the like, and their results converge, solid foundations
for a new perspective on language–logic relations would be
constructed.
With this qualification, can we conclude that the philosophers were right? Gottlob Frege, in his Begriffschrift,
famously asserted that linguistic rules relate to logic as
the eye compares to a microscope (van Heijenoort 1967):
language is flexible, but logic is more rigid—mediating
between linguistic expressions and objects suitable to reasoning. While Frege and Russell had no cognitive perspective, let alone a neurological one, we feel free to add one
and assign an anatomical construal of Frege’s assertion in
regards to the spatial position of the left Id7: like a microscope, this area may “translate” linguistic objects into logical forms. A mediating role has already been proposed for
the posteriorly adjacent, middle left insula, claimed to mediate between motor planning and speech (Dronkers 1996).
In a similar vein, it is proposed that the left Id7 mediates
between the language regions and prefrontal areas engaged
in reasoning (Baggio et al. 2016; Monti et al. 2007). By
doing so, it seems to play a crucial role in what could be a
core neural network that underlies our humanity.
