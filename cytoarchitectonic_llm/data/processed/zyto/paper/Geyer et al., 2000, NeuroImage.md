**INTRODUCTION**

In a previous article (Geyer et al., 1999), the cytoarchitectonic borders of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 of the human
primary somatosensory cortex were identified with a
new observer-independent and statistically testable
procedure (Schleicher et al., 1999) in 10 postmortem
brains. Significant changes in cytoarchitecture were


detected at corresponding positions across a series of
nearby sections in each brain. These borders matched
visible changes in cytoarchitecture in cell-stained sections. Area 3a lies in the fundus of the central sulcus,
and area 3b in the rostral bank of the postcentral gyrus
(or posterior bank of the central sulcus). Area 1 occupies the crown of the postcentral gyrus and reaches
down into the postcentral sulcus.
Plenty of evidence in nonhuman primates shows that
cytoarchitectonic areas are also functional entities
(see, e.g., Matelli et al., 1991; Luppino et al., 1991).
_Macrostructural landmarks yield clues as to the ap-_
_proximate location of a cortical area, i.e., fundus of the_
central sulcus, area 3a; rostral bank of the postcentral
gyrus (or posterior bank of the central sulcus), area 3b;
and crown of the gyrus, area 1. Borders of cortical
areas, however, can only be detected by microstruc_tural analysis. There are no dimples, notches, or_
grooves that mark these borders reliably across a series of individual brains. Thus, areal borders and the
extent of most cortical areas cannot be identified in
high-resolution magnetic resonance images. This
leaves a substantial degree of uncertainty when, based
only on macroanatomical landmarks of the postcentral
gyrus, investigators attempt to assign activation foci in
positron emission tomography (PET) or functional
magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans to cytoarchitectonic areas.
For a solution of this problem, the atlas of Talairach
and Tournoux (1988) is only of limited value. The authors used Brodmann’s (1909) nomenclature of cortical
areas, but the atlas is based on one brain only, which
“was not subjected to histologic studies and the transfer of the cartography of Brodmann usually pictured in
two-dimensional projections sometimes possesses uncertainties” (Talairach and Tournoux, 1988, p. 10). The
authors seem to have transferred each area from Brodmann’s schematic drawing to a corresponding position
on the cortex of the Talairach brain. This allows only
an approximate description of each area’s location,
since interareal borders were not defined. Further

more, Brodmann’s map shows each area on the free
cortical surface only. Approximately 60% of the cortex,
however, is buried in the depths of the sulci (Zilles et
_al., 1988). In addition, analysis of only one brain does_
not address the problem of interindividual variability
of cortical areas. Thus, the validity of the “Brodmann
areas” as delineated in the Talairach atlas must be
seriously questioned.
These problems can be solved by using a MRI-based
brain atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996a) which
maintains the original 3-D format of the data and
displays genuine microstructural and functional data
that were spatially normalized to its reference brain.

This reference brain is a common spatial reference
system to assess the degree of interindividual microstructural variability (Geyer et al., 1996; Roland et al.,
1997; Roland and Zilles, 1998; Amunts et al., 1999a,
1999b) and to correlate microstructural with functional
imaging data (Geyer et al., 1996; Roland and Zilles,
1998; Naito et al., 1999).
In the previous paper (Geyer et al., 1999), somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1 were cytoarchitectonically
delineated in 10 postmortem brains. In this study,
these areas are spatially normalized to the reference
brain of the computerized Human Brain Atlas (Roland
and Zilles, 1994, 1996a), with an approach based on a
new extended principal axes theory and a fast automated multiresolution full-multigrid movement model
(Schormann and Zilles, 1997, 1998). Corresponding areas from different brains are superimposed in 3-D
space to show the degree of interindividual topographical variability. This is the prerequisite for probabilis_tic microstructural–functional correlation with, e.g.,_
PET data (Geyer et al., 1996; Roland and Zilles, 1998;
Naito et al., 1999).

_Histological Processing and Cytoarchitectonic_
_Analysis_

The histological processing and cytoarchitectonic
analysis have been described in detail in the previous
article (Geyer et al., 1999). Only major points will be
summarized here. The cytoarchitectonic analysis was
done in 10 postmortem brains obtained at autopsy from
subjects with no known history of neurological or psychiatric diseases (6 males and 4 females, mean age 64.3
years, range 37–85 years; cf. Table 2). All subjects were
included in the body donor program of the Anatomical
Institute (University of Düsseldorf, Germany). The
brains were fixed in 4% formaldehyde or in Bodian’s
fixative (90 ml of 80% ethanol, 5 ml of 37% formaldehyde, and 5 ml of glacial acetic acid) for 5 months. They
were suspended at the basilar artery to avoid compression during fixation. T1-weighted MRI scans (1.5 T
Siemens Magnetron SP scanner; 3-D fast, low angle
shot (3-D FLASH) pulse sequence; flip angle � 40°; TR
� 40 ms; TE � 5 ms; voxel size � 1.17 mm (mediolateral) � 1 mm (rostrocaudal) � 1 mm (dorsoventral))
were acquired for documentation of brain size and
shape before subsequent histological processing, which
induces shrinkage and distortions. The brains were
dehydrated in graded alcohols, embedded in paraffin,
and sectioned coronally (20-�m whole brain sections)
with a microtome for large sections. Images of the
paraffin blockface were obtained after each 60th section with a CCD camera (image matrix: 256 � 256
pixels; 8 bit grey value resolution). Each 60th section
was mounted on a gelatin-coated slide and was stained
for cell bodies with a modified silver method (Merker,
1983), which yields high-contrast staining of cell bodies
for cytoarchitectonic analysis and delineation of areas
3a, 3b, and 1 in both hemispheres (see Geyer et al.,
1999).

_3-D Reconstruction of the Histological Volume_

Each mounted and cell-stained histological section
was digitized with a CCD camera (image matrix:
256 � 256 pixels; 8 bit grey value resolution). The histological volume of the brain was then reconstructed in
3-D from (i) the images of the paraffin blockface (for
proper alignment of the sections), (ii) the digitized histological sections (for demonstration of the microstructure), and (iii) the MR volume of the same brain (for
correction of distortions) with linear and nonlinear
transformations (Schormann et al., 1993, 1995, 1996,
1997; Schormann and Zilles, 1997, 1999). Since the MR
volume was obtained prior to histological processing,
any artifacts (e.g., shrinkage of the brain due to dehydration in graded alcohols or compression of the sec


g)
reconstructed histological volume by matching with
the MR volume of the same brain. An image analysis
software package with an interactive voxel-painting
program (KS 400, Version 3.0; Zeiss, Germany) was
used to label the extent of areas 3a, 3b, and 1 in the
images of corresponding sections of the reconstructed
volume according to each area’s borders, which had
been detected in each histological section by observerindependent delineation of cytoarchitectonic borders.
With this approach, a microstructurally defined representation of cytoarchitectonic areas 3a, 3b, and 1 was
obtained in the 3-D reconstructed histological volume
of each brain.

_Spatial Normalization_

Each 3-D reconstructed histological volume (with areas 3a, 3b, and 1) was spatially normalized to the
reference brain (which is oriented in the Talairach
coordinate system, viz Roland et al., 1994) of the computerized Human Brain Atlas with an approach based
on a new extended principal axes theory (PAT; Schormann et al., 1997) and a fast automated multiresolution full-multigrid movement model (Schormann and
Zilles, 1997, 1998).
The system of transformations is applied in a hierarchical manner from coarse to fine thereby combining
low and high dimensional transformations. In a first
step, the individual histological volumes are transformed to the reference brain with an extended PAT
generalized to affine transformation parameters. This
theory extends the classical PAT to non-rigid linear
transformations which are at least one order of magnitude more accurate than the results of the classical
PAT (Schormann and Zilles, 1997). This technique is
insensitive to noise or to symmetries of objects and
does not require any interactive support for correlating
corresponding landmarks (e.g., points, lines, or surfaces) in both volumes. Such a global or coarse registration accounts for differences in scaling (size), rotation (orientation), translation (position), and shearing
which result from different eigensystems of both volumes (Schormann et al., 1993). The extended PAT precisely aligns objects on the basis of linear parameters
which is an important prerequisite for the nonlinear
refinement by a fast automated full-multigrid movement technique (Schormann and Zilles, 1997, 1998).
The histological volumes are modeled as elastic material whereby the transformation to the reference brain
is smooth so that connected regions remain connected
and global relationships between structures are maintained. In order to account for large deformations, it is
necessary to extend the elastic model to a movement
model whereby the histological volume is deformed
iteratively by using the result of the previous iteration
for the next step until a satisfactory match is achieved

g p
lion degrees of freedom were used for the histological
volumes in order to account for the different morphology between individual and reference brain whereby
the transformations of the coarse and fine stage were
determined without any interactive support. High dimensional and linear transformations were combined
and applied to each 3-D reconstructed histological volume with areas 3a, 3b, and 1.
The 10 normalized histological volumes were superimposed in the 3-D space of the reference brain. Population maps were generated for corresponding areas
from different brains, which show the degree of interindividual microstructural variability by exemplifying,
for each voxel, how many brains have a representation
of one particular cytoarchitectonic area. For quantitative analysis, the data from the left and right hemispheres were pooled.

**RESULTS**

Figure 1A shows a dorsal view of postmortem brain
207/84 after fixation for 5 months in formalin. The
brain was then scanned with a 3-D FLASH pulse sequence, subsequently embedded in paraffin, and sectioned coronally (20-�m whole brain sections) with a
microtome for large sections. Then 7561 sections were
obtained from this brain. Each 60th section was
mounted and stained for cell bodies with a modified
silver method. Section 3061 is shown in Fig. 1B (cf.
dashed line in Fig. 1A). Areas 3a, 3b, and 1 are
marked, as defined by observer-independent identification of cytoarchitectonic borders (see Geyer et al.,
1999). The 3-D reconstructed histological volume of
brain 207/84 is shown in Fig. 1C, and a coronal section
through this volume that corresponds to section 3061
is shown in Fig. 1D (cf. dashed line in Fig. 1C). Areas
3a, 3b, and 1 were labeled interactively in images of
coronal sections of the reconstructed histological volume according to each area’s extent in the corresponding cell-stained sections (cf. Figs. 1B and 1D).
Each 3-D reconstructed histological volume was
then spatially normalized to the reference brain (volume rendering shown in Fig. 2A) of the computerized
atlas. The histological volume of brain 68/95 is depicted prior to normalization in Fig. 2B and after normalization in Fig. 2C. After spatial normalization the
gyral and sulcal pattern of brain 68/95 (Fig. 2C)
matches the pattern of the reference brain (Fig. 2A). A
sagittal section through the normalized histological
volume of brain 68/95 with areas 3a, 3b, and 1 is shown
in Fig. 2D (x ��19; cf. dashed line in Fig. 2C).
The normalized histological volumes of all 10 brains
were then aligned in 3-D space and superimposed. A
mean brain was generated in which each voxel represents the arithmetic mean of the grey values of the
s perimposed histological ol mes ( ol me rendering

at x ��16 (cf. dashed line in Fig. 3A) in Fig. 3B).
Corresponding views of the reference brain are depicted in Figs. 3C (volume rendering) and 3D (sagittal
section at x ��16 (cf. dashed line in Fig. 3C)). There is
a good match between the gyral and sulcal patterns of
the mean brain and the reference brain.
Population maps were generated for corresponding
areas from the 10 normalized histological volumes.
Figures 4B–4D depict the population maps of areas 3a,
3b, and 1, respectively (right hemisphere; x ��49;
reference brain (cf. Fig. 4A) is shown in the background). These population maps describe, for each
voxel, how many brains have a representation of one
particular cytoarchitectonic area. This representation
is color coded in a spectral sequence from dark blue
(area is present in only 1 of 10 brains in this voxel) to
dark red (in all 10 brains). Despite considerable interindividual variability, a clear focus is obvious for each
area. The focus of area 3a lies in the depth of the
central sulcus toward its fundus (Fig. 4B), the focus of
area 3b in the rostral bank of the postcentral gyrus (or
posterior bank of the central sulcus; Fig. 4C), and the
focus of area 1 on the crown of the postcentral gyrus
(Fig. 4D).
The volume of each area’s representation (in both
hemispheres) in 1 of 10 brains is 13.64 cm3 for area 3a,
23.09 cm3 for area 3b, and 18.16 cm3 for area 1 (Fig.
5A). Conversely, the volume of each area’s representation (both hemispheres) in �5 of 10 brains is 1.68 cm3

for area 3a, 4.02 cm3 for area 3b, and 7.34 cm3 for area
1. If each area’s entire representation (in �1 of 10
brains) in both hemispheres is defined as 100% (Fig.
5B), the representation in 1 of 10 brains is 53.77% for
area 3a, 44.45% for area 3b, and 42.41% for area 1,
whereas the representation in �5 of 10 brains is 6.61%
for area 3a, 7.72% for area 3b, and 17.18% for area 1
(exploded pie slices in Fig. 5B).
The volume of each area’s representation in a small
number of brains (1 of 10, 2 of 10, etc.) is large. Conversely, each area’s representation in a large number
of brains is relatively small. When superimposing the
population maps of all three areas in 3-D space, it is
impossible to unequivocally assign many voxels in
standard anatomical space to area 3a or area 3b or area
1 due to considerable interindividual variability on the
one hand and the close spatial relationship of the three
areas in the postcentral gyrus on the other hand. This
problem arises, however, when nonoverlapping volumes of interest (VOIs) are to be defined for each area
(e.g., for measurements of changes in regional cerebral
blood flow in these microstructural VOIs in PET or
fMRI data which have been brought into the same
spatial format). A representation of each area in �50%
of the brains is an adequate compromise between a
sufficiently large VOI of each area and a minimal number of o erlapping o els bet een adjacent VOIs (area

(in cm3) in both hemispheres is depicted in Fig. 6B.
Volumes of overlap between adjacent VOIs are minimal (area 3a � area 3b, 0.059 cm3 or 0.46% of the total
volume of all three VOIs in both hemispheres (cf Fig


6C); area 3b � area 1, 0.083 cm3 or 0.64% of the total
volume of all three VOIs in both hemispheres (cf. Fig.
6C)).

Human Brain Atlas (Roland and Zilles, 1994, 1996a).
Corresponding areas from different brains were superimposed in 3-D space, and population (or probability)
maps were generated for each area which show the
degree of microstructural interindividual variability.
On this basis, microstructural and functional imaging
data can be correlated in a probabilistic way.
Microstructural–functional correlation is validated
by many findings in nonhuman primates, which show
that cortical areas as functional entities can be defined
_only on a microstructural basis, e.g., by cytoarchitec-_
ture. In humans, however, the situation is more complex, since interareal borders do not match macrostructural landmarks of the cortex, and they vary
considerably in their positions relative to these landmarks across different brains (Rademacher et al., 1993;
Roland and Zilles, 1994; Rajkowska and Goldman-Rakic, 1995; Geyer et al., 1996, 1999; Roland and Zilles,
1996b; White et al., 1997; Roland et al., 1997; Amunts
_et al., 1999a). In addition, in humans, unlike in mon-_
keys, functional and postmortem microstructural studies cannot be performed in the same brain. Published
atlases, e.g., the atlas of Talairach and Tournoux
(1988), are of limited value in this respect, as their
cortical maps are not based on genuine microstructural
data, they give only the approximate position of an
area, and they do not address the problem of interindividual variability.
The procedure outlined in this article is an approach
to overcome these problems. Genuine microstructural
data (e.g., cytoarchitectonic analysis of cell-stained sections obtained from postmortem brains) are brought
into the standard anatomical format of the atlas. The
degree of interindividual variability can be assessed by
importing microstructural data from several brains
(approximately 10 in order to keep the time-consuming
and cumbersome procedure of microstructural parcellation within reasonable limits). Functional imaging
data can then be brought into the identical standard
anatomical format, superimposed with the microstructural data, and correlated with them on a probabilistic
basis.
Macrostructural variability between brains is well
known and has been extensively documented in the
recent literature (Ono et al., 1990; Loftus et al., 1995;
Thompson et al., 1996; Penhune et al., 1996; Paus et al.,
1996a, 1996bs; White et al., 1997; Bartley et al., 1997;
Zilles et al., 1997; Kennedy et al., 1998; Leonard et al.,
1998; Varnavas and Grand, 1999; Westbury et al.,
1999; Tomaiuolo et al., 1999). Unfortunately, the biological rules of genetics and development are complex
and the differential contributions of genetic and environmental factors (Bartley et al., 1997), which lead to
this diversity are largely unknown. Hence, no a priori
mathematical model of choice that adequately describes these nderl ing factors is c rrentl a ailable


y p
parameters are only an approximation of this complexity. When different brains are normalized with the
proportional grid system of Talairach and Tournoux
(1988), considerable residual macroanatomical variability remains, e.g., in the rostrocaudal position of the
central sulcus (see Fig. 7 of Talairach and Tournoux,
1988).
Therefore, in this study a new and mathematically
more powerful warping technique was used which does
not require any user interaction (since interactive approaches to normalize brains cannot be reproduced
across different investigators and the quality of fit depends on each investigator’s experience). The approach
is based on a new extended principal axes theory and a
fast automated multiresolution full-multigrid movement model (Schormann and Zilles, 1997, 1998). The
power and accuracy of this new technique in comparison with other warping approaches was recently tested
(Crivello et al., 1999) with 20 MRI volumes (1.5 T GE
Horizon LX scanner; T1 weighted spoiled gradient sequence), which were spatially normalized to the reference brain with four different warping techniques: (i) a
simple nine parameter model, (ii) the nonlinear procedure implemented in the statistical parametric mapping (SPM) package (Ashburner and Friston, 1997),
(iii) the 5th order (168 parameters) nonlinear warping
algorithm included in the automated image registration (AIR) tool (Woods et al., 1998), and (iv) the multiresolution full-multigrid movement model (FMG;
which was used in this study). The adjusted mean MRI
volume across the 20 subjects was computed for each
procedure, and difference volumes (mean volumeSPM �
mean volumeFMG and mean volumeSPM � mean volumeAIR) were generated. The difference volumes revealed that the SPM and AIR algorithms performed
similarly whereas the FMG approach dramatically improved the spatial accuracy with which each individual
brain was adapted to the reference brain (Crivello et
_al., 1999). Hence, the residual macroanatomical vari-_
ability is dramatically reduced (although not eliminated altogether) with this new FMG approach. Figure
3B shows a sagittal section through the mean brain
generated from the 10 normalized histological volumes. The outer contour and the ventricular surface
are sharp but sulci and subcortical nuclei are slightly
blurred. It can therefore be assumed that each area’s
“interindividual variability” as shown in the population maps is due to minimal residual macroanatomical
variability but the rest is indeed microstructural in
nature.
Considerable interindividual microstructural variability leads to overlapping regions when population
maps of areas with close spatial relationship in the
cortex are superimposed in standard anatomical space.

ever, clear foci are obvious for each area in cortical
regions which are in accordance with the published
literature (area 3a in the ascending part of the postcentral gyrus close to the fundus of the central sulcus,
area 3b in the rostral bank, and area 1 on the crown of
the postcentral gyrus). Considering each area’s representation in an increasing number of brains (�2 of 10,
�3 of 10, etc.) considerably reduces the spatial extent
of each area’s VOI and the n mber of o erlapping


voxels between the VOIs of adjacent areas. With a very
high number of brains (�6 of 10, �7 of 10, etc.), however, the VOIs of small cortical areas (e.g., area 3a)
become exceedingly small (cf. Fig. 5A). In addition,
there are increasingly wide gaps (i.e., a microstructural “no man’s land”) between anatomically adjacent
areas. This situation never occurs in an individual
brain, as two adjacent areas always have a common

each area and a minimal degree of overlap between
adjacent VOIs.
This opens up the exciting possibility of defining
VOIs of somatosensory areas 3a, 3b, and 1, which are
not based on macroanatomical landmarks but instead
on cytoarchitectonic mapping of postmortem brains.
Probabilistic microstructural data can now be correlated with probabilistic functional data, i.e., PET or
fMRI data can be brought into the same anatomical
format of the computerized atlas, and changes in regional cerebral blood flow can be calculated in VOIs
that are derived from genuine microstructural analysis. Only from this probabilistic microstructural—functional correlation can we infer whether a PET or fMRI
activation engages only one or several adjacent cytoarchitectonic areas of the human cerebral cortex.

_Technical Note_

The population maps of the microstructure of areas
3a, 3b, and 1 are part of the European Computerized
Human Brain Database (ECHBD; Roland et al., 1999).
The ECHBD is a 3-D database for relating function to
the microstructure of the human cerebral cortex. 3-D
images of postmortem brains in which cortical areas
have been mapped with quantitative microstructural
techniques are available in standard anatomical format, as are 3-D images of statistical maps of PET and
fMRI experiments, and equivalent current dipoles from
magnetoencephalography (MEG) and electroencephalography (EEG) experiments. The ECHBD is open for
use and submission. Researchers can directly compare
the localization and extent of their functional activations with the population maps of cytoarchitectural
areas and the results from other PET, fMRI, MEG, and
EEG experiments. Further details can be found at the
ECHBD website: www.dhbr.neuro.ki.se.
